# CODEOWNERS for autoreview assigning in github

# File pattern follows the same rules used in .gitignore files,
# Note: doc/ means files in any folder named doc, and its subfolders
# while doc/* means files in any folder named doc, but not its subfolders.
#
# Ordering is important: the last matching pattern takes precedence.
# Put global owners at the top, and detailed reviewers later
#
# Additional reviewers can be assigned manually

# Default/global reviewers (if not overridden later)
