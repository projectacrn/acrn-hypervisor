Contribution Guidelines
#######################

As an open-source project, we welcome and encourage the community to submit
patches directly to the project.  In our collaborative open-source environment,
standards and methods for submitting changes help reduce the chaos that can result
from an active development community.

This document briefly summarizes the full `Contribution
Guidelines <http://projectacrn.github.io/latest/developer-guides/contribute_guidelines.html>`_
documentation.

* ACRN uses the permissive open source `BSD 3-Clause license`_
  that allows you to freely use, modify, distribute and sell your own products
  that include such licensed software.

* There are some imported or reused components of the ACRN project that
  use other licensing and are clearly identified.

* The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) process is followed to
  ensure developers are following licensing criteria for their
  contributions, and documented with a ``Signed-off-by`` line in commits.

* ACRN development workflow is supported on Linux.

* Source code for the project is maintained in the GitHub repo:
  https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor

* Issue and feature tracking is done using GitHub issues in this repo.

* A Continuous Integration (CI) system runs on every Pull Request (PR)
  to verify several aspects of the PR including Git commit formatting,
  coding style, sanity-check builds, and documentation builds.

* The `ACRN user mailing list`_ is a great place to engage with the
  community, ask questions, discuss issues, and help each other.
