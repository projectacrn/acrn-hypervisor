Usage of acrn.efi
*******************

Suggest to follow the following step:
a. Build out the acrn.efi image with command "make PLATFORM=uefi".
b. Rename the original os loader file that is located at
\\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTX64.EFI as CL_BL.EFI which name can be user defined
in the config file bsp/uefi/include/bsp/bsp_cfg.h, the default name
is CL_BL.EFI.
c. Copy acrn.efi to \\EFI\\BOOT\\, and rename it to BOOTX64.EFI
d. Reboot
e. If you want to recover to origianal os loader, just replace
the BOOTX64.EFI with the CL_BL.EFI.
