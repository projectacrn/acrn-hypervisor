Contribute Guides
*****************

As an open-source project, we welcome and encourage the community to
submit patches for code, documentation, tests, and more, directly to the
project. Here's where you'll find how the development team works and the
guidelines they (and you) use to contribute code (and documentation) to
the project.

The project has a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) that is responsible
for all technical oversight of the open source Project. The role and rules
governing the operations of the TSC are described in the project's
`technical-charter`_. Members of the TSC are listed with their contact
details in the :ref:`tsc_members` paragraph.
