a) The magic number is defined as a MACRO with a name clearly indicating its
   meaning.
b) The meaning of the magic number is clearly documented in the comments before
   its usage.
c) The meaning of the magic number is straightforward in the specific context.

===================================================================================

This rule only applies to the Assembly file which uses .end directive. .end
directive shall be the last statement in this case. All the statements past .end
directive will not be processed by the assembler.

Compliant example::

    #include <types.h>
    #include <spinlock.h>
    
    .macro asm_showcase_mov
            movl    $0x1, %eax
    .endm
    
    .end

.. rst-class:: non-compliant-code

   Non-compliant example::

       #include <types.h>
       
       .end

       asm_test:
               movl    $0x6, %eax


ASM-GN-09: Far jump shall be used with restrictions
===================================================

Jumping to an instruction located in a different segment shall only be used for
the following two cases:

a) Code bit changes, such as change from 32-bit mode to 64-bit mode.
b) System resumes from S3. In this case, Global Descriptor Table (GDT) is set by
   Bootloader/BIOS and far jump has to be used to correct the Code Segment (CS).

Compliant example::

    .code32
    execution_32:
            /*
             * do something in 32-bit mode,
             * then,
             * perform a far jump to start executing in 64-bit mode
             */
            ljmp    $0x0008, $execution_64_2
    
    .code64
    execution_64_1:
            /* do something in 64-bit mode */
    
    execution_64_2:
            /* do something in 64-bit mode */

.. rst-class:: non-compliant-code

   Non-compliant example::

       .data
       asm_showcase_data:
               .word   0x0008
       
       .code32
       execution_32:
               /* do something in 32-bit mode */
               ljmp    $0x0008, $asm_showcase_data


ASM-GN-10: Assembler directives shall be used with restrictions
===============================================================

Usage of the assembler directive refers to GNU assembler 'as' user manual. Only
the following assembler directives may be used:

1) .align
2) .end
3) .extern
4) repeat related directives, including .rept and .endr
5) global related directives, including .global and .globl
6) macro related directives, including .altmacro, .macro, and .endm
7) code bit related directives, including .code16, .code32, and .code64
8) section related directives, including .section, .data, and .text
9) number emission related directives, including .byte, .word, .short, .long,
   and .quad
10) .org, which shall be used with restrictions. It shall only be used to
    advance the location counter due to code bit changes, such as change from 32-bit
    mode to 64-bit mode.

Coding Style
************

ASM-CS-01: One instruction statement shall not be split into multiple lines
===========================================================================

Compliant example::

    movl    $0x2, %eax

.. rst-class:: non-compliant-code

   Non-compliant example::

       movl    $0x2, \
       %eax


ASM-CS-02: Assembler directive statements shall be aligned
==========================================================

An assembler directive statement is composed of directive and arguments.
Arguments are optional depending on the use case.
Some detailed rules about the alignment are listed below:

a) Assembler directives shall be aligned with one tab if the statement is in the
   code block under any label from functional perspective. Otherwise, assembler
   directives shall be aligned to the start of the line.
b) Tabs shall be used to separate the directive and the first argument, where
   applicable. The number of tabs could be decided by the developers based on each
   case and it shall guarantee that the first argument is aligned in each directive
   block.
c) A single space shall be used to separate multiple arguments.

Compliant example::

    .extern         cpu_primary_save32
    .extern         cpu_primary_save64
    
    .section        multiboot_header, "a"
    .align          4
    .long           0x0008
    .long           0x0018
    
    .section        entry, "ax"
    .align          8
    .code32

.. rst-class:: non-compliant-code

   Non-compliant example::

          .extern      cpu_primary_save32
          .extern   cpu_primary_save64
       
       .section     multiboot_header, "a"
       .align  4
       .long     0x0008
       .long   0x0018
       
          .section   entry, "ax"
          .align   8
         .code32


ASM-CS-03: Labels shall be aligned to the start of the line
===========================================================

Compliant example::

    asm_showcase_1:
            movl    $0x1, %eax

.. rst-class:: non-compliant-code

   Non-compliant example::

          asm_showcase_2:
            movl    $0x2, %eax


ASM-CS-04: Instruction statements shall be aligned
==================================================

An instruction statement is composed of instruction prefix, instruction
mnemonic, and instruction operands. Instruction prefix and instruction operands
are optional depending on the use case.
Some detailed rules about the alignment are listed below:

a) The start of instruction statements shall be aligned with one tab if the
   instruction statement is in the code block under any label from functional
   perspective. Otherwise, the start of instruction statements shall be aligned to
   the start of the line. The start of the instruction could either be the
   instruction mnemonic or the instruction prefix.
b) One space shall be used to separate the instruction prefix and the
   instruction mnemonic, where applicable.
c) Tabs shall be used to separate the instruction mnemonic and the first
   instruction operand, where applicable. The number of tabs could be decided by
   the developers based on each case and it shall guarantee that the first
   instruction operand in the code block under one label is aligned.
d) A single space shall be used to separate multiple operands.

Compliant example::

    asm_showcase_1:
            movl            $0x1, %eax
            lock and        %rcx, (%rdx)

       asm_showcase_2:
           movl     $0x2, %eax


ASM-CS-05:  '//' shall not be used for comments
===============================================

'/* \*/' shall be used to replace '//' for comments.

Compliant example::

    /* This is a comment */
    movl    $0x1, %eax

.. rst-class:: non-compliant-code

   Non-compliant example::

       // This is a comment
       movl    $0x1, %eax


ASM-CS-06: Tabs shall be 8 characters wide
==========================================

A tab character shall be considered 8-character wide when limiting the line
width.


ASM-CS-07: Each line shall contain at most 120 characters
=========================================================

No more than 120 characters shall be on a line, with tab stops every 8
characters.

Compliant example::

    /*
     * This is a comment. This is a comment. This is a comment. This is a comment.
     * This is a comment. This is a comment. This is a comment.
     */

.. rst-class:: non-compliant-code

   Non-compliant example::

       /* This is a comment. This is a comment. This is a comment. This is a comment. This is a comment. This is a comment. This is a comment. */



Naming Convention
*****************

ASM-NC-01: Lower case letters shall be used for case insensitive names
======================================================================

This rule applies to assembler directive, instruction prefix, instruction
mnemonic, and register name.
