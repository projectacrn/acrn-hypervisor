Drawings Using Graphviz
#######################

We support using the Sphinx `graphviz extension`_ for creating simple
graphs and line drawings using the dot language.  The advantage of using
graphviz for drawings is that source for a drawing is a text file that
can be edited and maintained in the repo along with the documentation.

.. _graphviz extension: http://graphviz.gitlab.io

These source ``.dot`` files are generally kept separate from the document itself,
and included by using a graphviz directive:

.. code-block:: none

   .. graphviz:: images/boot-flow.dot
      :name: boot-flow-example
      :align: center
      :caption: ACRN Hypervisor Boot Flow

Where the boot-flow.dot file contains the drawing commands:

.. literalinclude:: images/boot-flow.dot

and the generated output would appear as this:

.. graphviz:: images/boot-flow.dot
  :name: boot-flow-example
  :align: center
  :caption: ACRN Hypervisor Boot Flow


Let's look at some more examples and then we'll get into more details
about the dot language and drawing options.

Simple Directed Graph
*********************

For simple drawings with shapes and lines, you can put the graphviz
commands in the content block for the directive. For example, for a
simple directed graph (digraph) with two nodes connected by an arrow,
you can write:


.. code-block:: none

    .. graphviz::

       digraph {
          "a" -> "b"
       }

and get this:

.. graphviz::

   digraph {
      "a" -> "b"
   }


You can change the graph layout (from top-to-bottom to left-to-right), node
shapes (rectangles, circles, house, star, etc.), style (filled, rounded),
and colors, along with the text displayed in the node, and the resulting
image placement on the page (centered):

.. literalinclude:: images/circle-square.dot

.. graphviz:: images/circle-square.dot
   :align: center

You can use the `standard HTML color names`_ or use RGB values for
colors, as shown.

Adding Edge Labels
******************

Here's an example of a drawing with labels on the edges (arrows)
between nodes. We also show how to change the default attributes for all
nodes and edges within this graph:

.. literalinclude:: images/node-shape-edges.dot

.. graphviz:: images/node-shape-edges.dot
   :align: center

Tables
******

For nodes with a ``record`` shape attribute, the text of the label is
presented in a table format:  a vertical bar ``|`` starts a new row or
column and curly braces ``{ ... }`` specify a new row (if you're in a
column) or a new column (if you're in a row).  For example:

.. literalinclude:: images/record.dot

.. graphviz:: images/record.dot
   :align: center

Note that you can also specify the horizontal alignment of text using escape
sequences ``\n``, ``\l`` and ``\r`` that divide the label into lines, centered,
left-justified, and right-justified, respectively.

Finite-State Machine
********************

Here's an example of using graphviz for defining a finite-state machine
for pumping gas:

.. literalinclude:: images/gaspump.dot

.. graphviz:: images/gaspump.dot
   :align: center
