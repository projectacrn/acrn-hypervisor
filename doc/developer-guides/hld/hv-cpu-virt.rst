   ACRN Hypervisor CPU Virtualization Components

The following sections discuss the major modules (indicated above in blue)
in the CPU virtualization overview shown in :numref:`hv-cpu-virt-components`.

Based on Intel VT-x virtualization technology, ACRN emulates a virtual CPU
(vCPU) with the following methods:

-  **core partition**: one vCPU is dedicated and associated with one
   physical CPU (pCPU),
   making much of the hardware register emulation simply
   passthrough. This provides good isolation for physical interrupts
   and guest execution.  (See `Static CPU Partitioning`_ for more
   information.)

-  **core sharing** (to be added): two or more vCPUs share one
   physical CPU (pCPU). A more complicated context switch is needed
   between different vCPUs' switching. This provides flexible computing
   resources sharing for low-performance demand vCPU tasks.
   (See `Flexible CPU Sharing`_ for more information.)

-  **simple schedule**: a well-designed scheduler framework that allows ACRN
   to adopt different scheduling policies, such as the **noop** and **round-robin**:

   - **noop scheduler**: only two thread loops are maintained for a CPU: a 
     vCPU thread and a default idle thread. A CPU runs most of the time in
     the vCPU thread for emulating a guest CPU, switching between VMX root
     mode and non-root mode. A CPU schedules out to default idle when an
     operation needs it to stay in VMX root mode, such as when waiting for
     an I/O request from the DM or when ready to destroy.

   - **round-robin scheduler** (to be added): allows more vCPU thread loops
     to run on a CPU. A CPU switches among different vCPU threads and default
     idle threads as it runs out corresponding timeslices or necessary
     scheduling outs such as waiting for an I/O request. A vCPU can yield
     itself as well, such as when it executes "PAUSE" instruction.


Static CPU partitioning
***********************

CPU partitioning is a policy for mapping a virtual
CPU (vCPU) to a physical CPU. To enable this, the ACRN hypervisor can
configure a noop scheduler as the schedule policy for this physical CPU.

ACRN then forces a fixed 1:1 mapping between a vCPU and this physical CPU
when creating a vCPU for the guest Operating System. This makes the vCPU
management code much simpler.

``cpu_affinity`` in ``vm config`` helps to decide which physical CPU a
VCPU in a VM affines to, then finalize the fixed mapping. When launching a
User VM, need to choose pCPUs from the VM's cpu_affinity that are not
used by any other VMs.

Flexible CPU Sharing
********************

To enable CPU sharing, ACRN hypervisor can configure IORR
(IO sensitive Round-Robin) or the BVT (Borrowed Virtual Time) scheduler
policy.

``cpu_affinity`` in ``vm config`` indicates all the physical CPUs on which
this VM is allowed to run. A pCPU can be shared among a Service VM and any
User VM as long as the local APIC passthrough is not enabled in that User
VM.

See :ref:`cpu_sharing` for more information.

CPU management in the Service VM under static CPU partitioning
==============================================================

With ACRN, all ACPI table entries are passthrough to the Service VM, including
the Multiple Interrupt Controller Table (MADT). The Service VM sees all
physical CPUs by parsing the MADT when the Service VM kernel boots. All
physical CPUs are initially assigned to the Service VM by creating the same
number of virtual CPUs.

When the Service VM boot is finished, it releases the physical CPUs intended
for User VM use.

Here is an example flow of CPU allocation on a multi-core platform.

.. figure:: images/static-core-image2.png
   :width: 600px
   :align: center
   :name: static-core-cpu-allocation

   CPU allocation on a multi-core platform

CPU management in the Service VM under flexible CPU sharing
===========================================================

As all Service VM CPUs could share with different User VMs, ACRN can still passthrough
MADT to Service VM, and the Service VM is still able to see all physical CPUs.

But as under CPU sharing, the Service VM does not need offline/release the physical
CPUs intended for User VM use.

CPU management in the User VM
=============================

``cpu_affinity`` in ``vm config`` defines a set of pCPUs that a User VM
is allowed to run on. acrn-dm could choose to launch on only a subset of the pCPUs
or on all pCPUs listed in cpu_affinity, but it can't assign
any pCPU that is not included in it.

CPU assignment management in HV
===============================

The physical CPU assignment is pre-defined by ``cpu_affinity`` in
``vm config``, while post-launched VMs could be launched on pCPUs that are
a subset of it.

Currently, the ACRN hypervisor does not support virtual CPU migration to
different physical CPUs. This means no changes to the virtual CPU to
physical CPU can happen without first calling offline_vcpu.


.. _vCPU_lifecycle:

vCPU Lifecycle
**************

A vCPU lifecycle is shown in :numref:`hv-vcpu-transitions` below, where
the major states are:

-  **VCPU_INIT**: vCPU is in an initialized state, and its vCPU thread
   is not ready to run on its associated CPU

-  **VCPU_RUNNING**: vCPU is running, and its vCPU thread is ready (in
   the queue) or running on its associated CPU

-  **VCPU_PAUSED**: vCPU is paused, and its vCPU thread is not running
   on its associated CPU

-  **VPCU_ZOMBIE**: vCPU is being offline, and its vCPU thread is not
   running on its associated CPU

-  **VPCU_OFFLINE**: vCPU is offline

vCPU Scheduling under static CPU partitioning
*********************************************

.. figure:: images/hld-image35.png
   :align: center
   :name: hv-vcpu-schedule

   ACRN vCPU scheduling flow under static CPU partitioning

As describes in the CPU virtualization overview, if under static
CPU partitioning, ACRN implements a simple scheduling mechanism
based on two threads: vcpu_thread and default_idle. A vCPU with
VCPU_RUNNING state always runs in a vcpu_thread loop, meanwhile
a vCPU with VCPU_PAUSED or VCPU_ZOMBIE state runs in default_idle
loop. The detail behaviors in vcpu_thread and default_idle threads
are illustrated in :numref:`hv-vcpu-schedule`:

-  The **vcpu_thread** loop will do the loop of handling vm exits,
   and pending requests around the VM entry/exit.
   It will also check the reschedule request then schedule out to
   default_idle if necessary. See `vCPU Thread`_ for more details
   of vcpu_thread.

-  The **default_idle** loop simply does do_cpu_idle while also
   checking for need-offline and reschedule requests.
   If a CPU is marked as need-offline, it will go to cpu_dead.
   If a reschedule request is made for this CPU, it will
   schedule out to vcpu_thread if necessary.

-  The function ``make_reschedule_request`` drives the thread
   switch between vcpu_thread and default_idle.

Some example scenario flows are shown here:

.. figure:: images/hld-image7.png
   :align: center

   ACRN vCPU scheduling scenarios

-  **During starting a VM**: after create a vCPU, BSP calls *launch_vcpu*
   through *start_vm*, AP calls *launch_vcpu* through vlapic
   INIT-SIPI emulation, finally this vCPU runs in a
   *vcpu_thread* loop.

-  **During shutting down a VM**: *pause_vm* function call makes a vCPU
   running in *vcpu_thread* to schedule out to *default_idle*. The
   following *reset_vcpu*  and *offline_vcpu* de-init and then offline
   this vCPU instance.

-  **During IOReq handling**: after an IOReq is sent to DM for emulation, a
   vCPU running in *vcpu_thread* schedules out to *default_idle*
   through *acrn_insert_request_wait->pause_vcpu*. After DM
   complete the emulation for this IOReq, it calls
   *hcall_notify_ioreq_finish->resume_vcpu* and makes the vCPU
   schedule back to *vcpu_thread* to continue its guest execution.

vCPU Scheduling under flexible CPU sharing
******************************************

To be added.

vCPU Thread
***********

The vCPU thread flow is a loop as shown and described below:

.. figure:: images/hld-image68.png
   :align: center

   ACRN vCPU thread


1. Check if *vcpu_thread* needs to schedule out to *default_idle* or
   other *vcpu_thread* by reschedule request. If needed, then schedule
   out to *default_idle* or other *vcpu_thread*.

2. Handle pending request by calling *acrn_handle_pending_request*.
   (See `Pending Request Handlers`_.)

3. VM Enter by calling *start/run_vcpu*, then enter non-root mode to do
   guest execution.

4. VM Exit from *start/run_vcpu* when guest trigger vm exit reason in
   non-root mode.

5. Handle vm exit based on specific reason.

6. Loop back to step 1.

vCPU Run Context
================

During a vCPU switch between root and non-root mode, the run context of
the vCPU is saved and restored using this structure:

.. doxygenstruct:: run_context
   :project: Project ACRN

The vCPU handles runtime context saving by three different
categories:

-  Always save/restore during vm exit/entry:

   -  These registers must be saved every time vm exit, and restored
      every time vm entry
   -  Registers include: general purpose registers, CR2, and
      IA32_SPEC_CTRL
   -  Definition in *vcpu->run_context*
   -  Get/Set them through *vcpu_get/set_xxx*

-  On-demand cache/update during vm exit/entry:

   -  These registers are used frequently. They should be cached from
      VMCS on first time access after a VM exit, and updated to VMCS on
      VM entry if marked dirty
   -  Registers include: RSP, RIP, EFER, RFLAGS, CR0, and CR4
   -  Definition in *vcpu->run_context*
   -  Get/Set them through *vcpu_get/set_xxx*

-  Always read/write from/to VMCS:

   -  These registers are rarely used. Access to them is always
      from/to VMCS.
   -  Registers are in VMCS but not list in the two cases above.
   -  No definition in *vcpu->run_context*
   -  Get/Set them through VMCS API

For the first two categories above, ACRN provides these get/set APIs:

ACRN implements its VM exit handlers with a static table. Except for the
exit reasons listed below, a default *unhandled_vmexit_handler* is used
that will trigger an error message and return without handling:

Details of each vm exit reason handler are described in other sections.

.. _pending-request-handlers:

Pending Request Handlers
========================

ACRN uses the function *acrn_handle_pending_request* to handle
requests before VM entry in *vcpu_thread*.

A bitmap in the vCPU structure lists the different requests:

.. code-block:: c

   #define ACRN_REQUEST_EXCP 0U
   #define ACRN_REQUEST_EVENT 1U
   #define ACRN_REQUEST_EXTINT 2U
   #define ACRN_REQUEST_NMI 3U
   #define ACRN_REQUEST_EOI_EXIT_BITMAP_UPDATE 4U
   #define ACRN_REQUEST_EPT_FLUSH 5U
   #define ACRN_REQUEST_TRP_FAULT 6U
   #define ACRN_REQUEST_VPID_FLUSH 7U /* flush vpid tlb */


ACRN provides the function *vcpu_make_request* to make different
requests, set the bitmap of the corresponding request, and notify the target
vCPU through the IPI if necessary (when the target vCPU is not currently
running). See :ref:`vcpu-request-interrupt-injection` for details.

.. code-block:: c

   void vcpu_make_request(struct vcpu *vcpu, uint16_t eventid)
   {
      uint16_t pcpu_id = pcpuid_from_vcpu(vcpu);

      bitmap_set_lock(eventid, &vcpu->arch_vcpu.pending_req);
      /*
       * if current hostcpu is not the target vcpu's hostcpu, we need
       * to invoke IPI to wake up target vcpu
       *
       * TODO: Here we just compare with cpuid, since cpuid currently is
       *  global under pCPU / vCPU 1:1 mapping. If later we enabled vcpu
       *  scheduling, we need change here to determine it target vcpu is
       *  VMX non-root or root mode
       */
      if (get_cpu_id() != pcpu_id) {
              send_single_ipi(pcpu_id, VECTOR_NOTIFY_VCPU);
      }
   }

For each request, function *acrn_handle_pending_request* handles each
request as shown below.

.. note:: Refer to the interrupt management chapter for request
   handling order for exception, nmi, and interrupts. For other requests
   such as tmr update, or EPT flush, there is no mandatory order.

VMX Initialization
******************

ACRN will attempt to initialize the vCPU's VMCS before its first
launch with the host state, execution control, guest state,
entry control and exit control, as shown in the table below.

The table briefly shows how each field got configured.
The guest state field is critical for a guest CPU start to run
based on different CPU modes.

For a guest vCPU's state initialization:

-  If it's BSP, the guest state configuration is done in SW load,
   which could be initialized by different objects:

   -  The Service VM BSP: hypervisor will do context initialization in different
      SW load based on different boot mode


   -  User VM BSP: DM context initialization through hypercall

-  If it's AP, then it will always start from real mode, and the start
       vector will always come from vlapic INIT-SIPI emulation.

CPUID Virtualization
********************

CPUID access from guest would cause VM exits unconditionally if executed
as a VMX non-root operation. ACRN must return the emulated processor
identification and feature information in the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX
registers.

To simplify, ACRN returns the same values from the physical CPU for most
of the CPUID, and specially handle a few CPUID features which are APIC
ID related such as CPUID.01H.

ACRN emulates some extra CPUID features for the hypervisor as well.

There is a per-vm *vcpuid_entries* array, initialized during VM creation
and used to cache most of the CPUID entries for each VM.  During guest
CPUID emulation, ACRN will read the cached value from this array, except
some APIC ID-related CPUID data emulated at runtime.

This table describes details for CPUID emulation:

MSR Virtualization
******************

ACRN always enables MSR bitmap in *VMX_PROC_VM_EXEC_CONTROLS* VMX
execution control field. This bitmap marks the MSRs to cause a VM
exit upon guest access for both read and write. The VM
exit reason for reading or writing these MSRs is respectively
*VMX_EXIT_REASON_RDMSR* or *VMX_EXIT_REASON_WRMSR* and the vm exit
handler is *rdmsr_vmexit_handler* or *wrmsr_vmexit_handler*.

This table shows the predefined MSRs ACRN will trap for all the guests. For
the MSRs whose bitmap are not set in the MSR bitmap, guest access will be
passthrough directly:

CR Virtualization
*****************

ACRN emulates ``mov to cr0``, ``mov to cr4``, ``mov to cr8``, and ``mov
from cr8`` through *cr_access_vmexit_handler* based on
*VMX_EXIT_REASON_CR_ACCESS*.

.. note::  Currently ``mov to cr8`` and ``mov from cr8`` are actually
   not valid as ``CR8-load/store exiting`` bits are set as 0 in
   *VMX_PROC_VM_EXEC_CONTROLS*.

A VM can ``mov from cr0`` and ``mov from
cr4`` without triggering a VM exit. The value read are the read shadows
of the corresponding register in VMCS. The shadows are updated by the
hypervisor on CR writes.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Operation**
     - **Handler**

   * - mov to cr0
     - Based on vCPU set context API: vcpu_set_cr0 -> vmx_write_cr0

   * - mov from cr8
     - Based on vlapic tpr API: vlapic_get_cr8->vlapic_get_tpr


For ``mov to cr0`` and ``mov to cr4``, ACRN sets
*cr0_host_mask/cr4_host_mask* into *VMX_CR0_MASK/VMX_CR4_MASK*
for the bitmask causing vm exit.

As ACRN always enables ``unrestricted guest`` in
*VMX_PROC_VM_EXEC_CONTROLS2*, *CR0.PE* and *CR0.PG* can be
controlled by guest.

   * - cr0_always_off_mask

   * - cr0_host_mask
     - ~(fixed0 ^ fixed1) | CR0_TRAP_MASK
     - ACRN will finally trap bits under VMX root mode control plus
       additionally added bits


For ``mov to cr0`` emulation, ACRN will handle a paging mode change based on
PG bit change, and a cache mode change based on CD and NW bits changes.
ACRN also takes care of  illegal writing from guest to invalid
CR0 bits (for example, set PG while CR4.PAE = 0 and IA32_EFER.LME = 1),
which will finally inject a #GP to guest. Finally,
*VMX_CR0_READ_SHADOW* will be updated for guest reading of host
controlled bits, and *VMX_GUEST_CR0* will be updated for real vmx cr0
setting.

The ``mov to cr4`` emulation is similar to cr0 emulation noted above.

.. _io-mmio-emulation:

IO/MMIO Emulation
*****************

ACRN always enables I/O bitmap in *VMX_PROC_VM_EXEC_CONTROLS* and EPT
in *VMX_PROC_VM_EXEC_CONTROLS2*. Based on them,
*pio_instr_vmexit_handler* and *ept_violation_vmexit_handler* are
used for IO/MMIO emulation for a emulated device. The emulated device
could locate in hypervisor or DM in the Service VM. Please refer to the "I/O
Emulation" section for more details.

For an emulated device done in the hypervisor, ACRN provide some basic
APIs to register its IO/MMIO range:

-  For the Service VM, the default I/O bitmap are all set to 0, which means
   the Service VM will passthrough all I/O port access by default. Adding an I/O handler
   for a hypervisor emulated device needs to first set its corresponding
   I/O bitmap to 1.

-  For the User VM, the default I/O bitmap are all set to 1, which means the User Vm will trap
   all I/O port access by default. Adding an I/O handler for a
   hypervisor emulated device does not need change its I/O bitmap.
   If the trapped I/O port access does not fall into a hypervisor
   emulated device, it will create an I/O request and pass it to the Service VM
   DM.

-  For the Service VM, EPT maps all range of memory to the Service VM except for ACRN hypervisor
   area. This means the Service VM will passthrough all MMIO access by
   default. Adding a MMIO handler for a hypervisor emulated
   device needs to first remove its MMIO range from EPT mapping.

-  For the User VM, EPT only maps its system RAM to the User VM, which means the User VM will
   trap all MMIO access by default. Adding an MMIO handler for a
   hypervisor emulated device does not need to change its EPT mapping.
   If the trapped MMIO access does not fall into a hypervisor
   emulated device, it will create an I/O request and pass it to the Service VM
   DM.

.. _instruction-emulation:

Instruction Emulation
*********************

ACRN implements a simple instruction emulation infrastructure for
MMIO (EPT) and APIC access emulation. When such a VM exit is triggered, the
hypervisor needs to decode the instruction from RIP then attempt the
corresponding emulation based on its instruction and read/write direction.

ACRN currently supports emulating instructions for ``mov``, ``movx``,
``movs``, ``stos``, ``test``, ``and``, ``or``, ``cmp``, ``sub`` and
``bittest`` without support for lock prefix.  Real mode emulation is not
supported.

.. figure:: images/hld-image82.png
   :align: center

   Instruction Emulation Work Flow

In the handlers for EPT violation or APIC access VM exit, ACRN will:

1. Fetch the MMIO access request's address and size

2. Do *decode_instruction*  for the instruction in current RIP
   with the following check:

   a. Is the instruction supported? If not, inject #UD to guest.
   b. Is GVA of RIP, dest, and src valid? If not, inject #PF to guest.
   c. Is stack valid? If not, inject #SS to guest.

3. If step 2 succeeds, check the access direction. If it's a write, then
   do *emulate_instruction* to fetch MMIO request's value from
   instruction operands.

4. Execute MMIO request handler, for EPT violation is *emulate_io*
   while APIC access is *vlapic_write/read* based on access
   direction. It will finally complete this MMIO request emulation
   by:

   a. putting req.val to req.addr for write operation
   b. getting req.val from req.addr for read operation

5. If the access direction is read, then do *emulate_instruction* to
   put MMIO request's value into instruction operands.

6. Return to guest.

TSC Emulation
*************

Guest vCPU execution of *RDTSC/RDTSCP* and access to
*MSR_IA32_TSC_AUX* does not cause a VM Exit to the hypervisor.
Hypervisor uses *MSR_IA32_TSC_AUX* to record CPU ID, thus
the CPU ID provided by *MSR_IA32_TSC_AUX* might be changed via Guest.

*RDTSCP* is widely used by hypervisor to identify current CPU ID. Due
to no VM Exit for *MSR_IA32_TSC_AUX* MSR register, ACRN hypervisor
saves/restores *MSR_IA32_TSC_AUX* value on every VM Exit/Enter.
Before hypervisor restores host CPU ID, *rdtscp* should not be
called as it could get vCPU ID instead of host CPU ID.

The *MSR_IA32_TIME_STAMP_COUNTER* is emulated by ACRN hypervisor, with a
simple implementation based on *TSC_OFFSET* (enabled
in *VMX_PROC_VM_EXEC_CONTROLS*):

-  For read: ``val = rdtsc() + exec_vmread64(VMX_TSC_OFFSET_FULL)``
-  For write: ``exec_vmwrite64(VMX_TSC_OFFSET_FULL, val - rdtsc())``

ART Virtualization
******************

The invariant TSC is based on the invariant timekeeping hardware (called
Always Running Timer or ART), that runs at the core crystal clock frequency.
The ratio defined by the CPUID leaf 15H expresses the frequency relationship
between the ART hardware and the TSC.

If CPUID.15H.EBX[31:0] != 0 and CPUID.80000007H:EDX[InvariantTSC] = 1, the
following linearity relationship holds between the TSC and the ART hardware:

   ``TSC_Value = (ART_Value * CPUID.15H:EBX[31:0]) / CPUID.15H:EAX[31:0] + K``

Where `K` is an offset that can be adjusted by a privileged agent.
When ART hardware is reset, both invariant TSC and K are also reset.

The guideline of ART virtualization (vART) is that software in native can run in
VM too. The vART solution is:

-  Present the ART capability to guest through CPUID leaf 15H for `CPUID.15H:EBX[31:0]`
   and `CPUID.15H:EAX[31:0]`.
-  Passthrough devices see the physical ART_Value (vART_Value = pART_Value)
-  Relationship between the ART and TSC in guest is:
   ``vTSC_Value = (vART_Value * CPUID.15H:EBX[31:0]) / CPUID.15H:EAX[31:0] + vK``
   Where `vK = K + VMCS.TSC_OFFSET`.
-  If `vK` or `vTSC_Value` are changed by guest, we change the `VMCS.TSC_OFFSET` accordingly.
-  `K` should never be changed by hypervisor.

XSAVE Emulation
***************

The XSAVE feature set is comprised of eight instructions:

-  *XGETBV* and *XSETBV* allow software to read and write the extended
   control register *XCR0*, which controls the operation of the
   XSAVE feature set.

-  *XSAVE*, *XSAVEOPT*, *XSAVEC*, and *XSAVES* are four instructions
   that save processor state to memory.

-  *XRSTOR* and *XRSTORS* are corresponding instructions that load
   processor state from memory.

-  *XGETBV*, *XSAVE*, *XSAVEOPT*, *XSAVEC*, and *XRSTOR* can be executed
   at any privilege level;

-  *XSETBV*, *XSAVES*, and *XRSTORS* can be executed only if CPL = 0.

Enabling the XSAVE feature set is controlled by XCR0 (through XSETBV)
and IA32_XSS MSR. Refer to the `Intel SDM Volume 1`_ chapter 13 for more details.


.. _Intel SDM Volume 1:

   :align: center

   ACRN Hypervisor XSAVE emulation

By default, ACRN enables XSAVES/XRSTORS in
*VMX_PROC_VM_EXEC_CONTROLS2*, so it allows the guest to use the XSAVE
feature. Because guest execution of *XSETBV* will always trigger XSETBV VM
exit, ACRN actually needs to take care of XCR0 access.

ACRN emulates XSAVE features through the following rules:

1. Enumerate CPUID.01H for native XSAVE feature support
2. If yes for step 1, enable XSAVE in hypervisor by CR4.OSXSAVE
3. Emulates XSAVE related CPUID.01H & CPUID.0DH to guest
4. Emulates XCR0 access through *xsetbv_vmexit_handler*
5. ACRN passthrough the access of IA32_XSS MSR to guest
6. ACRN hypervisor does NOT use any feature of XSAVE
7. As ACRN emulate vCPU with partition mode, so based on above rules 5
   and 6, a guest vCPU will fully control the XSAVE feature in
   non-root mode.
