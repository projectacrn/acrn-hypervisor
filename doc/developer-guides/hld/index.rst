High-Level Design Guides
########################

The ACRN Hypervisor acts as a host with full control of the processor(s)
and the hardware (physical memory, interrupt management and I/O). It
provides the User OS with an abstraction of a virtual platform, allowing
the guest to behave as if were executing directly on a logical
processor.

These chapters describe the ACRN architecture, high-level design,
background, and motivation for specific areas within the ACRN hypervisor
system.
