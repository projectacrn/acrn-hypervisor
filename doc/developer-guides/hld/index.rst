High-Level Design Guides
########################

The ACRN Hypervisor acts as a host with full control of the processors
and the hardware (physical memory, interrupt management, and I/O). It
provides the User OS with an abstraction of a virtual platform, allowing
the guest to behave as if it were executing directly on a physical
processor.

These chapters describe the ACRN architecture, high-level design,
background, and motivation for specific areas within the ACRN hypervisor
system.
