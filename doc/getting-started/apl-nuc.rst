Getting started guide for Intel NUC
###################################

The Intel |reg| NUC (NUC6CAYH) is the primary tested
platform for ACRN development, and its setup is described below.


Hardware setup
**************

Two Apollo Lake Intel platforms, described in :ref:`hardware`, are currently
supported for ACRN development:

- The `UP Squared board <http://www.up-board.org/upsquared/>`_ (UP2) is also
  known to work and its setup is described in :ref:`getting-started-up2`.

Firmware update on the NUC
==========================

You may need to update to the latest UEFI firmware for the NUC hardware.
Follow these `BIOS Update Instructions
<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005636.html>`__
for downloading and flashing an updated BIOS for the NUC.

Software setup
**************

Set up a Clear Linux Operating System
=====================================

Currently, an installable version of ARCN does not exist. Therefore, you
need to setup a base Clear Linux OS and you'll build and bootstrap ACRN
on your platform. You'll need a network connection for your platform to
complete this setup.

.. note::

   ACRN v0.4 (and the current master branch) requires Clear Linux
   version 26770 or newer.  If you use a newer version of Clear Linux,
   you'll need to adjust the instructions below to reference the version
   number of Clear Linux you are using.

#. Download the compressed Clear installer image from
   https://download.clearlinux.org/releases/26770/clear/clear-26770-installer.img.xz
   and follow the `Clear Linux installation guide
   <https://clearlinux.org/documentation/clear-linux/get-started/bare-metal-install>`__
   as a starting point for installing Clear Linux onto your platform.  Follow the recommended
   options for choosing an **Manual (Advanced)** installation type, and using the platform's
   storage as the target device for installation (overwriting the existing data
   and creating three partitions on the platform's storage drive).
   
   High-level steps should be: 
   
   #.  Install Clear on a NUC using the "Manual (Advanced)" option.
   #.  Use default partition scheme for storage
   #.  Name the host "clr-sos-guest"
   #.  Add an administrative user "clear" with "sudoers" privilege
   #.  Add these additional bundles "editors", "user-basic", "desktop-autostart", "network-basic"
   #.  For network, choose “DHCP”

#. After installation is complete, boot into Clear Linux, login as
   **clear**, and set a password.

#. Clear Linux is set to automatically update itself. We recommend that you disable
   this feature to have more control over when the updates happen. Use this command
   to disable the autoupdate feature:

   .. code-block:: none

      $ sudo swupd autoupdate --disable

   .. note::
      The Clear Linux installer will automatically check for updates and install the
      latest version available on your system. If you wish to use a specific version
      (such as 26770), you can achieve that after the installation has completed using
      ``sudo swupd verify --fix --picky -m 26770``
       
#. If you have an older version of Clear Linux already installed
   on your hardware, use this command to upgrade Clear Linux
   to version 26770 (or newer):

   .. code-block:: none

      $ sudo swupd update -m 26770     # or newer version

#. Use the ``sudo swupd bundle-add`` command and add these Clear Linux bundles:

   .. code-block:: none

      $ sudo swupd bundle-add service-os kernel-iot-lts2018 

   .. table:: Clear Linux bundles
      :widths: auto
      :name: CL-bundles

      +--------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
      | Bundle             | Description                                       |

      |                    | Service OS kernel                                 |

      |                    | which is enterprise-style kernel with backports   |
      +--------------------+---------------------------------------------------+


Add the ACRN hypervisor to the EFI Partition
============================================

In order to boot the ACRN SOS on the platform, you'll need to add it to the EFI
partition. Follow these steps:

#. Mount the EFI partition and verify you have the following files:

   .. code-block:: none

      $ sudo ls -1 /boot/EFI/org.clearlinux
      bootloaderx64.efi
      kernel-org.clearlinux.native.4.19.8-670
      kernel-org.clearlinux.iot-lts2018-sos.4.19.5-29
      kernel-org.clearlinux.iot-lts2018.4.19.5-29
      kernel-org.clearlinux.pk414-sos.4.14.74-115
      loaderx64.efi

   .. note::
      On Clear Linux, the EFI System Partion (e.g.: ``/dev/sda1``) is mounted under ``/boot`` by default
      The Clear Linux project releases updates often, sometimes
      twice a day, so make note of the specific kernel versions (*iot-lts2018 and *iot-lts2018-sos*) listed on your system,
      as you will need them later.

   .. note::
      The EFI System Partition (ESP) may be different based on your hardware.
      It will typically be something like ``/dev/mmcblk0p1`` on platforms
      that have an on-board eMMC or ``/dev/nvme0n1p1`` if your system has
      a non-volatile storage media attached via a PCI Express (PCIe) bus
      (NVMe).

#. Put the ``acrn.efi`` hypervisor application (included in the Clear
   Linux release) on the EFI partition with:

   .. code-block:: none

      $ sudo mkdir /boot/EFI/acrn
      $ sudo cp /usr/lib/acrn/acrn.efi /boot/EFI/acrn/

#. Configure the EFI firmware to boot the ACRN hypervisor by default

   The ACRN hypervisor (``acrn.efi``) is an EFI executable
   loaded directly by the platform EFI firmware. It then in turns loads the
   Service OS bootloader. Use the ``efibootmgr`` utility to configure the EFI
   firmware and add a new entry that loads the ACRN hypervisor.

   .. code-block:: none

      $ sudo efibootmgr -c -l "\EFI\acrn\acrn.efi" -d /dev/sda -p 1 -L "ACRN"

   .. note::

      Be aware that a Clearlinux update that includes a kernel upgrade will
      reset the boot option changes you just made. A Clearlinux update could
      happen automatically (if you have not disabled it as described above),
      if you later install a new bundle to your system, or simply if you
      decide to trigger an update manually. Whenever that happens,
      double-check the platform boot order using ``efibootmgr -v`` and
      modify it if needed.

   The ACRN hypervisor (``acrn.efi``) accepts two command-line parameters that
   tweak its behaviour:

   1. ``bootloader=``: this sets the EFI executable to be loaded once the hypervisor
      is up and running. This is typically the bootloader of the Service OS and the
      default value is to use the Clearlinux bootloader, i.e.:
      ``\EFI\org.clearlinux\bootloaderx64.efi``.
   #. ``uart=``: this tells the hypervisor where the serial port (UART) is found or
      whether it should be disabled. There are three forms for this parameter:

      #. ``uart=disabled``: this disables the serial port completely
      #. ``uart=mmio@<MMIO address>``: this sets the serial port MMIO address
      #. ``uart=port@<port address>``: this sets the serial port address

   Here is a more complete example of how to configure the EFI firmware to load the ACRN
   hypervisor and set these parameters.

   .. code-block:: none

      $ sudo efibootmgr -c -l "\EFI\acrn\acrn.efi" -d /dev/sda -p 1 -L "ACRN NUC Hypervisor" \
            -u "bootloader=\EFI\org.clearlinux\bootloaderx64.efi uart=disabled"

#. Create a boot entry for the ACRN Service OS by copying a provided ``acrn.conf``
   and editing it to account for the kernel versions noted in a previous step.

   It must contain these settings:

   +-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Setting   | Description                                                    |
   +===========+================================================================+
   | title     | Text to show in the boot menu                                  |
   +-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | linux     | Linux kernel for the Service OS (\*-sos)                       |
   +-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | options   | Options to pass to the Service OS kernel (kernel parameters)   |
   +-----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

   A starter acrn.conf configuration file is included in the Clear Linux release and is
   also available in the acrn-hypervisor/hypervisor GitHub repo as `acrn.conf
   <https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor/blob/master/hypervisor/bsp/uefi/clearlinux/acrn.conf>`__
   as shown here:

   .. literalinclude:: ../../hypervisor/bsp/uefi/clearlinux/acrn.conf
      :caption: hypervisor/bsp/uefi/clearlinux/acrn.conf

   On the platform, copy the ``acrn.conf`` file to the EFI partition we mounted earlier:

   .. code-block:: none

      $ sudo cp /usr/share/acrn/samples/nuc/acrn.conf /boot/loader/entries/

   You will need to edit this file to adjust the kernel version (``linux`` section),
   insert the ``PARTUUID`` of your ``/dev/sda3`` partition
   (``root=PARTUUID=<UUID of rootfs partition>``) in the ``options`` section, and
   add the ``hugepagesz=1G hugepages=2`` at end of the ``options`` section.

   Use ``blkid`` to find out what your ``/dev/sda3`` ``PARTUUID`` value is.

   .. note::
      It is also possible to use the device name directly, e.g. ``root=/dev/sda3``

   .. code-block:: none

   
#. Add a timeout period for Systemd-Boot to wait, otherwise it will not
   present the boot menu and will always boot the base Clear Linux

   .. code-block:: none

      $ sudo clr-boot-manager set-timeout 20
      $ sudo clr-boot-manager update


#. Reboot and select "The ACRN Service OS" to boot, as shown below:


   .. code-block:: console
      :emphasize-lines: 1
      :caption: ACRN Service OS Boot Menu
     
      => The ACRN Service OS
      Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture (Clear-linux-iot-lts2018-4.19.5-29)
      Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture (Clear-linux-iot-lts2018-sos-4.19.5-29)
      Clear Linux OS for Intel Architecture (Clear-linux-native.4.19.8-670)
      EFI Default Loader
      Reboot Into Firmware Interface

#. After booting up the ACRN hypervisor, the Service OS will be launched
   automatically by default, and the Clear Linux desktop will be showing with user "clear",
   (or you can login remotely with an "ssh" client).
   If there is any issue which makes the GNOME desktop doesn't show successfully, then the system will go to 
   shell console.

#. From ssh client, login as user "clear" using the password you set previously when
   you installed Clear Linux.

#. After rebooting the system, check that the ACRN hypervisor is running properly with: 
  
  .. code-block:: none

   $ dmesg | grep ACRN
   [    0.000000] Hypervisor detected: ACRN
   [    1.687128] ACRNTrace: acrn_trace_init, cpu_num 4
   [    1.693129] ACRN HVLog: acrn_hvlog_init

If you see log information similar to this, the ACRN hypervisor is running properly
and you can start deploying a User OS.  If not, verify the EFI boot options, SOS
kernel, and ``acrn.conf`` settings are correct (as described above).
    

ACRN Network Bridge
===================

ACRN bridge has been setup as a part of systemd services for device communication. The default
bridge creates ``acrn_br0`` which is the bridge and ``acrn_tap0`` as an initial setup. The files can be
found in ``/usr/lib/systemd/network``. No additional setup is needed since systemd-networkd is
automatically enabled after a system restart.

Set up Reference UOS
====================

#. On your platform, download the pre-built reference Clear Linux UOS
   image version 26770 (or newer) into your (root) home directory:

   .. code-block:: none

      $ cd ~
      $ mkdir uos
      $ cd uos
      $ curl -O https://download.clearlinux.org/releases/26770/clear/clear-26770-kvm.img.xz

   .. note::
      In case you want to use or try out a newer version of Clear Linux as the UOS, you can
      download the latest from http://download.clearlinux.org/image. Make sure to adjust the steps
      described below accordingly (image file name and kernel modules version).

#. Uncompress it:

   .. code-block:: none

      $ unxz clear-26770-kvm.img.xz

#. Deploy the UOS kernel modules to UOS virtual disk image (note: you'll need to use
   the same **iot-lts2018** image version number noted in step 1 above):

   .. code-block:: none

      $ sudo losetup -f -P --show clear-26770-kvm.img
      $ sudo mount /dev/loop0p3 /mnt
      $ sudo cp -r /usr/lib/modules/4.19.5-29.iot-lts2018 /mnt/lib/modules/
      $ sudo umount /mnt
      $ sync

#. Edit and Run the ``launch_uos.sh`` script to launch the UOS.

   A sample `launch_uos.sh
   <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor/master/devicemodel/samples/nuc/launch_uos.sh>`__
   is included in the Clear Linux release, and
   is also available in the acrn-hypervisor/devicemodel GitHub repo (in the samples
   folder) as shown here:

   .. literalinclude:: ../../devicemodel/samples/nuc/launch_uos.sh
      :caption: devicemodel/samples/nuc/launch_uos.sh
      :language: bash
      :emphasize-lines: 23,25

   .. note::
      In case you have downloaded a different Clear Linux image than the one above
      (``clear-26770-kvm.img.xz``), you will need to modify the Clear Linux file name
      and version number highlighted above (the ``-s 3,virtio-blk`` argument) to match
      what you have downloaded above. Likewise, you may need to adjust the kernel file
      name on the second line highlighted (check the exact name to be used using:
      ``ls /usr/lib/kernel/org.clearlinux.iot-lts2018*``).

   By default, the script is located in the ``/usr/share/acrn/samples/nuc/``
   directory. You can edit it there, and then run it to launch the User OS:

   .. code-block:: none

      $ cd /usr/share/acrn/samples/nuc/
      $ sudo ./launch_uos.sh

#. At this point, you've successfully booted the ACRN hypervisor,
   SOS, and UOS:

   .. figure:: images/gsg-successful-boot.png
      :align: center
      :name: gsg-successful-boot


Build ACRN from Source
**********************

If you would like to build ACRN hypervisor and device model from source,
follow these steps.

Install build tools and dependencies
====================================

ARCN development is supported on popular Linux distributions,
each with their own way to install development tools:

  .. note::
     ACRN uses ``menuconfig``, a python3 text-based user interface (TUI) for
     configuring hypervisor options and using python's ``kconfiglib`` library.

* On a Clear Linux development system, install the necessary tools:

  .. code-block:: none

     $ sudo swupd bundle-add os-clr-on-clr os-core-dev python3-basic
     $ pip3 install --user kconfiglib

* On a Ubuntu/Debian development system:

  .. code-block:: none

     $ sudo apt install gcc \
          git \
          make \
          gnu-efi \
          libssl-dev \
          libpciaccess-dev \
          uuid-dev \
          libsystemd-dev \
          libevent-dev \
          libxml2-dev \
          libusb-1.0-0-dev \
          python3 \
          python3-pip \
          libblkid-dev \
          e2fslibs-dev
     $ sudo pip3 install kconfiglib

  .. note::
     You need to use ``gcc`` version 7.3.* or higher else you will run into issue
     `#1396 <https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor/issues/1396>`_. Follow
     these instructions to install the ``gcc-7`` package on Ubuntu 16.04:

     .. code-block:: none

        $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
        $ sudo apt update
        $ sudo apt install g++-7 -y
        $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-7 60 \
                             --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-7

  .. note::
     Ubuntu 14.04 requires ``libsystemd-journal-dev`` instead of ``libsystemd-dev``
     as indicated above.

* On a Fedora/Redhat development system:

  .. code-block:: none

     $ sudo dnf install gcc \
          git \
          make \
          findutils \
          gnu-efi-devel \
          libuuid-devel \
          openssl-devel \
          libpciaccess-devel \
          systemd-devel \
          libxml2-devel \
          libevent-devel \
          libusbx-devel \
          python3 \
          python3-pip \
          libblkid-devel \
          e2fsprogs-devel
     $ sudo pip3 install kconfiglib


* On a CentOS development system:

  .. code-block:: none

     $ sudo yum install gcc \
             git \
             make \
             gnu-efi-devel \
             libuuid-devel \
             openssl-devel \
             libpciaccess-devel \
             systemd-devel \
             libxml2-devel \
             libevent-devel \
             libusbx-devel \
             python34 \
             python34-pip \
             libblkid-devel \
             e2fsprogs-devel
     $ sudo pip3 install kconfiglib

  .. note::
     You may need to install `EPEL <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`_ for
     installing python3 via yum for CentOS 7. For CentOS 6 you need to install
     pip manually. Please refer to https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing for
     details.


Build the hypervisor, device model and tools
============================================

The `acrn-hypervisor <https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor/>`_
repository has three main components in it:

1. The ACRN hypervisor code located in the ``hypervisor`` directory
#. The ACRN devicemodel code located in the ``devicemodel`` directory
#. The ACRN tools source code located in the ``tools`` directory

You can build all these components in one go as follows:

.. code-block:: none

   $ git clone https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor
   $ cd acrn-hypervisor
   $ make

The build results are found in the ``build`` directory.

.. note::
   if you wish to use a different target folder for the build
   artefacts, set the ``O`` (that is capital letter 'O') to the
   desired value. Example: ``make O=build-nuc BOARD=nuc6cayh``.

Generating the documentation is described in details in the :ref:`acrn_doc`
tutorial.

You can also build these components individually. The following
steps assume that you have already cloned the ``acrn-hypervisor`` repository
and are using it as the current working directory.

#. Build the ACRN hypervisor.

   .. code-block:: none

      $ cd hypervisor
      $ make BOARD=nuc6cayh

   The build results are found in the ``build`` directory.

#. Build the ACRN device model (included in the acrn-hypervisor repo):

   .. code-block:: none

      $ cd ../devicemodel
      $ make

   The build results are found in the ``build`` directory.

#. Build the ACRN tools (included in the acrn-hypervisor repo):

   .. code-block:: none

      $ cd ../tools
      $ for d in */; do make -C "$d"; done

Follow the same instructions to boot and test the images you created
from your build.

Generate the hypervisor configurations
======================================

The ACRN hypervisor leverages Kconfig to manage configurations, powered by
Kconfiglib. A default configuration is generated based on the board you have
selected via the ``BOARD=`` command line parameter. You can make further
changes to that default configuration to adjust to your specific
requirements.

To generate hypervisor configurations, you need to build the hypervisor
individually. The following steps generate a default but complete configuration,
based on the platform selected, assuming that you are under the top-level
directory of acrn-hypervisor. The configuration file, named ``.config``, can be
found under the target folder of your build.

   .. code-block:: none

      $ cd hypervisor
      $ make defconfig BOARD=nuc6cayh

The BOARD specified is used to select a defconfig under
``arch/x86/configs/``. The other command-line based options (e.g. ``RELEASE``)
take no effects when generating a defconfig.

Modify the hypervisor configurations
====================================

To modify the hypervisor configurations, you can either edit ``.config``
manually, or invoke a TUI-based menuconfig, powered by kconfiglib, by executing
``make menuconfig``. As an example, the following commands, assuming that you
are under the top-level directory of acrn-hypervisor, generate a default
configuration file for UEFI, allow you to modify some configurations and build
the hypervisor using the updated ``.config``.

   .. code-block:: none

      $ cd hypervisor
      $ make defconfig BOARD=nuc6cayh
      $ make menuconfig              # Modify the configurations per your needs
      $ make                         # Build the hypervisor with the new .config

   .. note::
      Menuconfig is python3 only.

Refer to the help on menuconfig for a detailed guide on the interface.

   .. code-block:: none

      $ pydoc3 menuconfig

Create a new default configuration
==================================

Currently the ACRN hypervisor looks for default configurations under
``hypervisor/arch/x86/configs/<BOARD>.config``, where ``<BOARD>`` is the
specified platform. The following steps allow you to create a defconfig for
another platform based on a current one.

   .. code-block:: none

      $ cd hypervisor
      $ make defconfig BOARD=nuc6cayh
      $ make menuconfig         # Modify the configurations
      $ make savedefconfig      # The minimized config reside at build/defconfig
      $ cp build/defconfig arch/x86/configs/xxx.config

Then you can re-use that configuration by passing the name (``xxx`` in the
example above) to 'BOARD=':

   .. code-block:: none

      $ make defconfig BOARD=xxx
