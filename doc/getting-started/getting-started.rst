Getting Started Guide
#####################

This guide will help you get started with ACRN. We'll show how to prepare a
build environment on your development computer. Then we'll walk through the
steps to set up a simple ACRN configuration on a target system. The
configuration is based on the ACRN predefined **industry** scenario and consists
of an ACRN hypervisor, Service VM, and one User VM, as illustrated in this
figure:

.. image:: ./images/gsg_scenario.png
   :scale: 80%

Throughout this guide, you will be exposed to some of the tools, processes, and
components of the ACRN project. Let's get started.

Prerequisites
**************

You will need two machines: a development computer and a target system. The
development computer is where you configure and build ACRN and your application.
The target system is where you deploy and run ACRN and your application.

   :scale: 60%

Before you begin, make sure your machines have the following prerequisites:

**Development computer**:

* Hardware specifications

  - A PC with Internet access (A fast system with multiple cores and 16MB
    memory or more will make the builds go faster.)

* Software specifications

  - Ubuntu Desktop 18.04 or newer
    (ACRN development is not supported on Windows.)

**Target system**:

* Hardware specifications

  - Target board (see :ref:`hardware_tested`)
  - Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop bootable USB disk: download the `Ubuntu 18.04.05 Desktop
    ISO image <https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.5/>`_ and follow the `Ubuntu documentation
    <https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overview>`__
    for instructions for creating the USB disk.
  - USB keyboard and mouse
  - Monitor
  - Ethernet cable and Internet access
  - Serial-to-USB cable to view the ACRN and VM console (optional)
  - A second USB disk with minimum 1GB capacity to copy files between the
    development computer and target system
  - Local storage device (NVMe or SATA drive, for example)

Set Up the Hardware
*******************

To set up the hardware environment:

#. Connect the mouse, keyboard, monitor, and power supply cable to the target
   system.

#. Connect the target system to the LAN with the Ethernet cable.

#. (Optional) Connect the serial cable between the target and development
   computer to view the ACRN and VM console (for an example, see :ref:`connect_serial_port`).

Prepare the Target and Generate a Board Configuration File
***************************************************************

A **board configuration file** is an XML file that stores hardware-specific information extracted from the target system. The file is used to configure
the ACRN hypervisor, because each hypervisor instance is specific to your
target hardware.

You use the **board inspector tool** to generate the board
configuration file.

.. important::

   Whenever you change the configuration of the board, such as BIOS settings,
   additional memory, or PCI devices, you must
   generate a new board configuration file.

Install OS on the Target
============================

The target system needs Ubuntu 18.04 to run the board inspector tool.

To install Ubuntu 18.04:

#. Insert the Ubuntu bootable USB disk into the target system.

#. Power on the target system, and select the USB disk as the boot device
   in the UEFI
   menu. Note that the USB disk label presented in the boot options depends on
   the brand/make of the USB drive. (You will need to configure the BIOS to boot
   off the USB device first, if that option isn't available.)

#. After selecting the language and keyboard layout, select the **Normal
   installation** and **Download updates while installing Ubuntu** (downloading
   updates requires the target to have an Internet connection).

   .. image:: ./images/gsg_ubuntu_install_01.png

#. Use the checkboxes to choose whether you'd like to install Ubuntu alongside
   another operating system, or delete your existing operating system and
   replace it with Ubuntu:

   .. image:: ./images/gsg_ubuntu_install_02.jpg
      :scale: 85%

#. Complete the Ubuntu installation and create a new user account ``acrn`` and
   set a password.

#. The next section shows how to configure BIOS settings.

Configure Target BIOS Settings
===============================

#. Boot your target and enter the BIOS configuration editor.

   Tip: When you are booting your target, youâ€™ll see an option (quickly) to
   enter the BIOS configuration editor, typically by pressing :kbd:`F2` during
   the boot and before the GRUB menu (or Ubuntu login screen) appears.

#. Configure these BIOS settings:

   * Enable **VMX** (Virtual Machine Extensions, which provide hardware
     assist for CPU virtualization).
   * Enable **VT-d** (Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O, which
     provides additional support for managing I/O virtualization).
   * Disable **Secure Boot**. This simplifies the steps for this example.

   The names and locations of the BIOS settings differ depending on the target
   hardware and BIOS version. You can search for the items in the BIOS
   configuration editor.

   For example, on a Tiger Lake NUC, quickly press :kbd:`F2` while the system
   is booting. (If the GRUB menu or Ubuntu login screen
   appears, press :kbd:`CTRL` + :kbd:`ALT` + :kbd:`DEL` to reboot again and
   press :kbd:`F2` sooner.) The settings are in the following paths:

   * **System Agent (SA) Configuration** > **VT-d** > **Enabled**
   * **CPU Configuration** > **VMX** > **Enabled**
   * **Boot** > **Secure Boot** > **Secure Boot** > **Disabled**

#. Set other BIOS settings, such as Hyper-Threading, depending on the needs
   of your application.

Generate a Board Configuration File
=========================================

#. On the target system, install the board inspector dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt install cpuid msr-tools pciutils dmidecode python3 python3-pip

#. Install the Python package dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo pip3 install lxml

#. Configure the GRUB kernel command line as follows:

   a. Edit the ``grub`` file. The following command uses ``vi``, but you
      can use any text editor.

      .. code-block:: bash

         sudo vi /etc/default/grub

   #. Find the line starting with ``GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`` and append:

      .. code-block:: bash

         idle=nomwait intel_idle.max_cstate=0 intel_pstate=disable

      Example:

      .. code-block:: bash

         GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash idle=nomwait intel_idle.max_cstate=0 intel_pstate=disable"

      These settings allow the board inspector tool to
      gather important information about the board.

   #. Save and close the file.

   #. Update GRUB and reboot the system:

      .. code-block:: bash

         sudo update-grub
         reboot

#. Copy the board inspector tool folder from the development computer to the
   target via USB disk as follows:

   a. Move to the development computer.

   #. On the development computer, insert the USB disk that you intend to
      use to copy files.

   #. Ensure that there is only one USB disk inserted by running the
      following command:

      .. code-block:: bash

         ls /media/$USER

      Confirm that one disk name appears. You'll use that disk name in
      the following steps.

   #. Copy the board inspector tool folder from the acrn-hypervisor source code to the USB disk:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd ~/acrn-work/
         disk="/media/$USER/"$(ls /media/$USER)
         cp -r acrn-hypervisor/misc/config_tools/board_inspector/ $disk/
         sync && sudo umount $disk

   #. Insert the USB disk into the target system.

   #. Copy the board inspector tool from the USB disk to the target:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir -p ~/acrn-work
         disk="/media/$USER/"$(ls /media/$USER)
         cp -r $disk/board_inspector ~/acrn-work

#. On the target, load the ``msr`` driver, used by the board inspector:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo modprobe msr

#. Run the board inspector tool ( ``board_inspector.py``)
   to generate the board configuration file. This
   example uses the parameter ``my_board`` as the file name.

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd ~/acrn-work/board_inspector/
      sudo python3 board_inspector.py my_board

#. Confirm that the board configuration file ``my_board.xml`` was generated
   in the current directory.

#. Copy ``my_board.xml`` from the target to the development computer
   via USB disk as follows:

   a. Make sure the USB disk is connected to the target.

   #. Copy ``my_board.xml`` to the USB disk:

      .. code-block:: bash

         disk="/media/$USER/"$(ls /media/$USER)
         cp ~/acrn-work/board_inspector/my_board.xml $disk/
         sync && sudo umount $disk

   #. Insert the USB disk into the development computer.

   #. Copy ``my_board.xml`` from the USB disk to the development computer:

      .. code-block:: bash

         disk="/media/$USER/"$(ls /media/$USER)
         cp $disk/my_board.xml ~/acrn-work
         sudo umount $disk

.. rst-class:: numbered-step

Generate a Scenario Configuration File and Launch Script
*********************************************************

You use the **ACRN configurator** to generate scenario configuration files and launch scripts.

A **scenario configuration file** is an XML file that holds the parameters of
a specific ACRN configuration, such as the number of VMs that can be run,
their attributes, and the resources they have access to.

A **launch script** is a shell script that is used to create a User VM.

To generate a scenario configuration file and launch script:

#. On the development computer, install ACRN configurator dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd ~/acrn-work/acrn-hypervisor/misc/config_tools/config_app
      sudo pip3 install -r requirements

#. Launch the ACRN configurator:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python3 acrn_configurator.py

#. Your web browser should open the website `<http://127.0.0.1:5001/>`__
   automatically, or you may need to visit this website manually.
   The ACRN configurator is supported on Chrome and Firefox.

#. Click the **Import Board info** button and browse to the board configuration
   file ``my_board.xml`` previously generated. When it is successfully
   imported, the board information appears.
   Example:

   .. image:: ./images/gsg_config_board.png
      :class: drop-shadow

#. Generate the scenario configuration file:

   a. Click the **Scenario Setting** menu on the top banner of the UI and select
      **Load a default scenario**. Example:

      .. image:: ./images/gsg_config_scenario_default.png
         :class: drop-shadow

   #. In the dialog box, select **industry** as the default scenario setting and click **OK**.

      .. image:: ./images/gsg_config_scenario_load.png
         :class: drop-shadow

   #. The scenario's configurable items appear. Feel free to look through all
      the available configuration settings used in this sample scenario. This
      is where you can change the sample scenario to meet your application's
      particular needs. But for now, leave them as they're set in the
      sample.

   #. Click the **Export XML** button to save the scenario configuration file
      that will be
      used in the build process.

   #. In the dialog box, keep the default name as is. Type
      ``/home/<username>/acrn-work`` in the Scenario XML Path field. In the
      following example, acrn is the username. Click **Submit** to save the
      file.

      .. image:: ./images/gsg_config_scenario_save.png
         :class: drop-shadow

   #. Confirm that ``industry.xml`` appears in the directory ``/home/<username>/acrn-work``.

#. Generate the launch script:

   a. Click the **Launch Setting** menu on the top banner of the UI and select
      **Load a default launch script**.

      .. image:: ./images/gsg_config_launch_default.png
         :class: drop-shadow

   #. In the dialog box, select **industry_launch_6uos** as the default launch
      setting and click **OK**.

      .. image:: ./images/gsg_config_launch_load.png
         :class: drop-shadow

   #. Click the **Generate Launch Script** button.

      .. image:: ./images/gsg_config_launch_generate.png
         :class: drop-shadow

   #. In the dialog box, type ``/home/<username>/acrn-work/`` in the Source Path
      field. In the following example, ``acrn`` is the username. Click **Submit**
      to save the script.

      .. image:: ./images/gsg_config_launch_save.png
         :class: drop-shadow

   #. Confirm that ``launch_uos_id3.sh`` appears in the directory
      ``/home/<username>/acrn-work/my_board/output/``.

#. Close the browser and press :kbd:`CTRL` + :kbd:`C` to terminate the
   ``acrn_configurator.py`` program running in the terminal window.

.. rst-class:: numbered-step

Build ACRN
***************

#. On the development computer, build the ACRN hypervisor:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd ~/acrn-work/acrn-hypervisor
      make -j $(nproc) BOARD=~/acrn-work/my_board.xml SCENARIO=~/acrn-work/industry.xml
      make targz-pkg

   The build typically takes a few minutes. By default, the build results are
   found in the build directory. For convenience, we also built a compressed tar
   file to ease copying files to the target.

#. Build the ACRN kernel for the Service VM:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd ~/acrn-work/acrn-kernel
      cp kernel_config_uefi_sos .config
      make olddefconfig
      make -j $(nproc) targz-pkg

   The kernel build can take 15 minutes or less on a fast computer, but could
   take 1-3 hours depending on the performance of your development computer.

#. Copy all the necessary files generated on the development computer to the
   target system by USB disk as follows:

   a. Insert the USB disk into the development computer and run these commands:

      .. code-block:: bash

         disk="/media/$USER/"$(ls /media/$USER)
         cp linux-5.10.52-acrn-sos-x86.tar.gz $disk/
         cp ~/acrn-work/acrn-hypervisor/build/hypervisor/acrn.bin $disk/
         cp ~/acrn-work/my_board/output/launch_uos_id3.sh $disk/
         cp ~/acrn-work/acpica-unix-20210105/generate/unix/bin/iasl $disk/
         cp ~/acrn-work/acrn-hypervisor/build/acrn-2.6-unstable.tar.gz $disk/
         sync && sudo umount $disk/

   #. Insert the USB disk you just used into the target system and run these
      commands to copy the tar files locally:

      .. code-block:: bash

         disk="/media/$USER/"$(ls /media/$USER)
         cp $disk/linux-5.10.52-acrn-sos-x86.tar.gz ~/acrn-work
         cp $disk/acrn-2.6-unstable.tar.gz ~/acrn-work

   #. Extract the Service VM files onto the target system:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd ~/acrn-work
         sudo tar -zxvf linux-5.10.52-acrn-sos-x86.tar.gz -C / --keep-directory-symlink

   #. Extract the ACRN tools and images:

      .. code-block:: bash

         sudo tar -zxvf acrn-2.6-unstable.tar.gz -C / --keep-directory-symlink

   #. Copy a few additional ACRN files to the expected locations:

      .. code-block:: bash

         sudo mkdir -p /boot/acrn/
         sudo cp $disk/acrn.bin /boot/acrn
         sudo cp $disk/iasl /usr/sbin/
         cp $disk/launch_uos_id3.sh ~/acrn-work
         sudo umount $disk/

.. rst-class:: numbered-step

Install ACRN
************

In the following steps, you will configure GRUB on the target system.

#. On the target, find the root file system (rootfs) device name by using the ``lsblk`` command:

   .. code-block:: console
      :emphasize-lines: 24

      ~$ lsblk

   As highlighted, you're looking for the device name associated with the
   partition named ``/``, in this case ``nvme0n1p2``.

#. Run the ``blkid`` command to get the UUID and PARTUUID for the rootfs device
   (replace the ``nvme0n1p2`` name with the name shown for the rootfs on your system):

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo blkid /dev/nvme0n1p2

   In the output, look for the UUID and PARTUUID (example below). You will need
   them in the next step.

   .. code-block:: console

      /dev/nvme0n1p2: UUID="3cac5675-e329-4cal-b346-0a3e65f99016" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="03db7f45-8a6c-454b-adf7-30343d82c4f4"

#. Add the ACRN Service VM to the GRUB boot menu:

   a. Edit the GRUB 40_custom file. The following command uses ``vi``, but
      you can use any text editor.

      .. code-block:: bash

         sudo vi /etc/grub.d/40_custom

   #. Add the following text at the end of the file. Replace ``"UUID"`` and
      ``"PARTUUID"`` with the output from the previous step.

      .. code-block:: bash
         :emphasize-lines: 6,8

         }

   #. Save and close the file.

#. Make the GRUB menu visible when
   booting and make it load the Service VM kernel by default:

   a. Edit the ``grub`` file:

      .. code-block:: bash

         sudo vi /etc/default/grub

   #. Edit lines with these settings (comment out the ``GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE`` line).
      Leave other lines as they are:

      .. code-block:: bash

      *ACRN Multiboot Ubuntu Service VM

.. rst-class:: numbered-step

Run ACRN and the Service VM
******************************

When the ACRN hypervisor starts to boot, the ACRN console log will be displayed
to the serial port (optional). The ACRN hypervisor boots the Ubuntu Service VM
automatically.

#. On the target, log in to the Service VM. (It will look like a normal Ubuntu
   session.)

#. Verify that the hypervisor is running by checking ``dmesg`` in
   the Service VM:

   .. code-block:: bash

      dmesg | grep ACRN

   You should see "Hypervisor detected: ACRN" in the output. Example output of a
   successful installation (yours may look slightly different):

   .. code-block:: console

      [  0.000000] Hypervisor detected: ACRN
      [  3.875620] ACRNTrace: Initialized acrn trace module with 4 cpu

.. rst-class:: numbered-step

Launch the User VM
*******************

#. A User VM image is required on the target system before launching it. The
   following steps use Ubuntu:

   a. Go to the `official Ubuntu website
      <https://releases.ubuntu.com/bionic>`__ to get an ISO format of the Ubuntu
      18.04 desktop image.

   #. Put the ISO file in the path ``~/acrn-work/`` on the target system.

#. Open the launch script in a text editor. The following command uses vi, but
   you can use any text editor.

   .. code-block:: bash

      vi ~/acrn-work/launch_uos_id3.sh

#. Look for the line that contains the term ``virtio-blk`` and replace
   the existing image file path with your ISO image file path.
   In the following example, the
   ISO image file path is ``/home/acrn/acrn-work/ubuntu-18.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso``.

   .. code-block:: bash
      :emphasize-lines: 4

      acrn-dm -A -m $mem_size -s 0:0,hostbridge -U 615db82a-e189-4b4f-8dbb-d321343e4ab3 \
         --mac_seed $mac_seed \
         $logger_setting \
         -s 7,virtio-blk,/home/acrn/acrn-work/ubuntu-18.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso \
         -s 8,virtio-net,tap_YaaG3 \
         -s 6,virtio-console,@stdio:stdio_port \
         --ovmf /usr/share/acrn/bios/OVMF.fd \
         -s 1:0,lpc \
         $vm_name

#. Save and close the file.

#. Launch the User VM:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo chmod +x ~/acrn-work/launch_uos_id3.sh
      sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/acrn-dm
      sudo chmod +x /usr/sbin/iasl
      sudo ~/acrn-work/launch_uos_id3.sh

#. Confirm that you see the console of the User VM on the Service VM's terminal
   (on the monitor connected to the target system). Example:

   .. code-block:: console

      Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS ubuntu hvc0

      ubuntu login:

#. Log in to the User VM. For the Ubuntu 18.04 ISO, the user is ``ubuntu``, and
   there's no password.

#. Confirm that you see output similar to this example:

   .. code-block:: console
