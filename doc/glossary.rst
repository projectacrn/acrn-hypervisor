   High GM
      See :term:`Hidden GM`

   Hybrid Mode
      One of three operation modes (hybrid, partition, sharing) that ACRN supports.
      In this mixed mode, physical hardware resources can be both partitioned to
      individual user VMs and shared across user VMs.

   I2C
      Inter-Integrated Circuit

   i915
      The Intel Graphics driver

   IC
      Instrument Cluster

   IDT
      Interrupt Descriptor Table: a data structure used by the x86
      architecture to implement an interrupt vector table. The IDT is used
      to determine the correct response to interrupts and exceptions.

   ISR
      Interrupt Service Routine: Also known as an interrupt handler, an ISR
      is a callback function whose execution is triggered by a hardware
      interrupt (or software interrupt instructions) and is used to handle
      high-priority conditions that require interrupting the current code
      executing on the processor.

   IVE
      In-Vehicle Experience

   IVI
      In-vehicle Infotainment

   OS
      Operating System

   OSPM
      Operating System Power Management

   Passthrough Device
      Physical devices (typically PCI) exclusively assigned to a guest.  In
      the Project ACRN architecture, passthrough devices are owned by the
      foreground OS.

   Partition Mode
      One of three operation modes (partition, sharing, hybrid) that ACRN supports.
      Physical hardware resources are partitioned to individual user VMs.

   PCI
      Peripheral Component Interface.

   PDE
      Page Directory Entry

   PM
      Power Management

   Pre-launched VM
      Pre-launched VMs are started by the ACRN hypervisor before the
      Service VM is launched. (See :term:`Post-launched VM`)

   Post-Launched VM
      Post-Launched VMs are launched and configured by the Service VM.
      (See :term:`Pre-launched VM`)

      Intel Resource Director Technology (Intel RDT) provides a set of
      monitoring and allocation capabilities to control resources such as
      Cache and Memory. ACRN supports Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) and
      Memory Bandwidth Allocation (MBA).

   RTVM
      Real-time VM. A specially-designed VM that can run hard real-time or
      soft real-time workloads (or applications) much more efficiently
      than the typical User VM through the use of a passthrough interrupt
      controller, polling-mode Virtio, Intel RDT allocation features (CAT,
      MBA), and I/O prioritization.  RTVMs are typically a :term:`pre-launched VM`.
      A non-:term:`safety VM` with real-time requirements is a
      :term:`post-launched VM`.

   Safety VM
      A special VM with dedicated hardware resources, running in
      partition mode, and providing overall system health-monitoring
      functionality.  Currently, a Safety VM is always a pre-launched User VM.

   Service VM
      The Service VM is generally the first VM launched by ACRN and can
      access hardware resources directly by running native drivers and
      provides device sharing services to User VMs via the Device Model.
