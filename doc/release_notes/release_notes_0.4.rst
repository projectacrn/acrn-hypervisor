ACRN v0.4 (Dec 2018)
####################

We are pleased to announce the release of Project ACRN version 0.4.

ACRN is a flexible, lightweight reference hypervisor, built with
real-time and safety-criticality in mind, optimized to streamline
embedded development through an open source platform. Check out the
:ref:`introduction` for more information.


All project ACRN source code is maintained in the
https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor repository and includes
folders for the ACRN hypervisor, the ACRN device model, and documentation.
You can either download this source code as a zip or tar.gz file (see
the `ACRN v0.4 GitHub release page
<https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor/releases/tag/v0.4>`_ or
use Git clone and checkout commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor
   cd acrn-hypervisor
   git checkout v0.4

The project's online technical documentation is also tagged to correspond
with a specific release: generated v0.4 documents can be found at
https://projectacrn.github.io/0.4/.  Documentation for the latest
(master) branch is found at https://projectacrn.github.io/latest/.

Known Issues
************

:acrn-issue:`1319` - SD card pass-through: UOS can't see SD card after UOS reboot.
   SD card could not be found after UOS reboot in pass-through mode.

   **Impact:** There is no SD card after UOS reboot.

   **Workaround:** None. The issue will be fixed in the next release.

:acrn-issue:`1773` - USB Mediator: Can't find all devices when multiple usb devices connected[Reproduce rate:60%]
   After booting UOS with multiple USB devices plugged in, there's a 60% chance that
   one or more devices are not discovered.

   **Impact:** Cannot use multiple USB devices at same time.

   **Workaround:** Unplug and plug-in the unrecognized device after booting.

:acrn-issue:`1774` - UOS can't stop by command: acrnctl stop [vm name] in SOS
   After launching UOS in SOS by "acrnctl start" command, UOS VM failed
   to be stopped by "acrnctl stop" command.

   **Impact:** Can't stop UOS in SOS.

   **Workaround:** None. The issue will be fixed in the next release.

:acrn-issue:`1775` - [APL UP2]ACRN debugging tool - acrntrace cannot be used in SOS
   There are no acrntrace devices "acrn_trace*" under SOS /dev.

   **Impact:** acrntrace cannot be used in SOS.

   **Workaround:** None. The issue will be fixed in the next release.

:acrn-issue:`1776` - [APL UP2]ACRN debugging tool - acrnlog cannot be used in SOS
   There are no acrnlog devices "acrn_hvlog*" under SOS /dev.

   **Impact:** acrnlog cannot be used in SOS.

   **Workaround:** None. The issue will be fixed in the next release.

:acrn-issue:`1780` - Some video formats cannot be played in SOS
   Video files with these encodings are not supported in the SOS:
   H265_10bits, VP8, VP9, VP9_10bits, H265.720p.

   **Impact:** Cannot play those formats of videos in SOS.

   **Workaround:** None. The issues will be fixed in the next release.

:acrn-issue:`1782` - UOS failed to get IP address with the pass-through network card
   After a network card is pass-through to UOS, it fails to get an IP address in UOS.

   **Impact:** Cannot use network in UOS.

   **Workaround:** None. The issues will be fixed in the next release.

:acrn-issue:`1796` - APL NUC fails to reboot sometimes
   After APL NUC boots to SOS, the "reboot" command sometimes fails to reboot the SOS.

   **Impact:** Cannot reboot SOS.

   **Workaround:** Power off and boot again. The issues will be fixed in the next release.

:acrn-issue:`1986` - UOS will hang once watchdog reset triggered
   If Launching UOS with "-s 8,wdt-i6300esb", UOS will hang if the watchdog reset is triggered.

   **Impact:** UOS cannot self-recover after a watchdog reset is triggered.

   **Workaround:** None.

:acrn-issue:`1987` - UOS will have same MAC address after launching UOS with virio-net
   After launching UOS with virio-net, UOS on different devices have the same MAC address.

   **Impact:** A UOS network conflict will exist.

   **Workaround:** None. This issues will be fixed in next release.

:acrn-issue:`1991` - Input is useless in UART Console for corner case
   Input is useless in UART Console for a corner case,
   demonstrated with these steps:

   1) Boot to SOS

   2) ssh into the SOS.

   3) use "./launch_UOS.sh" to boot UOS.

   4) On the host, use "minicom -s dev/ttyUSB0".

   5) Use "sos_console 0" to launch SOS.

   **Impact:** Failed to use UART for input in corner case.

   **Workaround:** Enter other keys before typing :kbd:`Enter`.

:acrn-issue:`1996` - There is an error log when using "acrnd&" to boot UOS
   An error log is printed when starting acrnd as a background job
   (``acrnd&``) to boot UOS. The UOS still boots up
   normally, but prints: "Failed to open the socket(sos-lcs) to query the reason for the wake-up.
   Activating all vms when acrnd & to boot uos."

   **Impact:** UOS boots normally, but prints an error log message.

   **Workaround:** None.

:acrn-issue:`2000` - After launching UOS with Audio pass-through, Device (I2C0) doesn't exist in UOS DSDT.dsl
   After launching UOS with Audio pass-through, Device (I2C0) doesn't exist in UOS DSDT.dsl

   **Impact:** Cannot use Audio device

   **Workaround:** None.

:acrn-issue:`2030` - UP2 fails to boot with uart=disabled for hypervisor
   SOS boots up fail following GSG document guide.

   **Impact:** SOS boots up fail on APL UP2

   **Workaround:** A step-by-step workaround has been updated in Github issue.

:acrn-issue:`2031` - UP2 serial port has no output with uart=mmio@0x91622000 for hypervisor
   After SOS starts, there's no display on the screen. Though ssh connection is successful, the serial port has no output.

   **Impact:** UP2 serial port has no output

   **Workaround:** A step-by-step workaround has been updated in Github issue.

.. comment
   Use the syntax:

   :acrn-issue:`663` - Short issue description
     Longer description that helps explain the problem from the user's
     point of view (not internal reasons).  **Impact:** What's the
     consequences of the issue, and how it can affect the user or system.
     **Workaround:** Describe a workaround if one exists (or refer them to the
     :acrn-issue:`663`` if described well there. If no workaround, say
     "none".
