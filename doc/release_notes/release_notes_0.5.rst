ACRN v0.5 (Jan 2019)
####################

We are pleased to announce the release of Project ACRN version 0.5.

ACRN is a flexible, lightweight reference hypervisor, built with
real-time and safety-criticality in mind, optimized to streamline
embedded development through an open source platform. Check out the
:ref:`introduction` for more information.


All project ACRN source code is maintained in the
https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor repository and includes
folders for the ACRN hypervisor, the ACRN device model, and documentation.
You can either download this source code as a zip or tar.gz file (see
the `ACRN v0.5 GitHub release page
<https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor/releases/tag/v0.5>`_ or
use Git clone and checkout commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor
   cd acrn-hypervisor
   git checkout v0.5

The project's online technical documentation is also tagged to correspond
with a specific release: generated v0.5 documents can be found at
https://projectacrn.github.io/0.5/.  Documentation for the latest
(master) branch is found at https://projectacrn.github.io/latest/.


Version 0.5 new features
************************

**OVMF support initial patches merged in ACRN**:
To support booting Windows as a Guest OS, we are
using Open source Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF).
Initial patches to support OVMF have been merged in ACRN hypervisor.
More patches for ACRN and patches upstreaming to OVMF work will be continuing.

**UP2 board serial port support**:
This release enables serial port debugging on UP2 boards during SOS and UOS boot.

**One E2E binary to support all UEFI platform**:
ACRN can support both Apollo Lake (APL) and Kaby Lake (KBL) NUCs.
Instead of having separate builds, this release offers community
developers a single end-to-end reference build that supports both
UEFI hardware platforms, configured with a new boot parameter.
See :ref:`getting_started` for more information.

**APL UP2 board with SBL firmware**: With this 0.5 release, ACRN
now supports APL UP2 board with slim Bootloader (SBL) firmware.
Slim Bootloader is a modern, flexible, light-weight, open source
reference boot loader with key benefits such as being fast, small,
customizable, and secure. An end-to-end reference build with
ACRN hypervisor, Clear Linux OS as SOS, and Clear Linux OS as UOS has been
verified on UP2/SBL board.

   one or more devices are not discovered.

   **Impact:** Cannot use multiple USB devices at same time.

   **Workaround:** Unplug and plug-in the unrecognized device after booting.

:acrn-issue:`1774` - UOS can't stop by command: acrnctl stop [vm name] in SOS
   After launching UOS in SOS by "acrnctl start" command, UOS VM failed
   to be stopped by "acrnctl stop" command.

   **Impact:** Can't stop UOS in SOS.

   **Workaround:** None. The issue will be fixed in the next release.

:acrn-issue:`1775` - [APL UP2]ACRN debugging tool - acrntrace cannot be used in SOS
   There are no acrntrace devices "acrn_trace*" under SOS /dev.

   **Workaround:** None. The issues will be fixed in the next release.

:acrn-issue:`1796` - APL NUC fails to reboot sometimes
   After APL NUC boots to SOS, the "reboot" command sometimes fails to reboot the SOS.

   **Impact:** Cannot reboot SOS.

   **Workaround:** Power off and boot again. The issues will be fixed in the next release.

:acrn-issue:`1991` - Input is useless in UART Console for corner case
   Input is useless in UART Console for a corner case,
   demonstrated with these steps:

   1) Boot to SOS

   2) ssh into the SOS.

   3) use "./launch_UOS.sh" to boot UOS.

   4) On the host, use "minicom -s dev/ttyUSB0".

   5) Use "sos_console 0" to launch SOS.

   **Impact:** Failed to use UART for input in corner case.

   **Workaround:** Enter other keys before typing :kbd:`Enter`.

:acrn-issue:`1996` - There is an error log when using "acrnd&" to boot UOS
   An error log is printed when starting acrnd as a background job
   (``acrnd&``) to boot UOS. The UOS still boots up
   normally, but prints: "Failed to open the socket(sos-lcs) to query the reason for the wake-up.
   Activating all vms when acrnd & to boot uos."

   **Impact:** UOS boots normally, but prints an error log message.

   **Workaround:** None.

:acrn-issue:`2267` - [APLUP2][LaaG]LaaG can't detect 4k monitor
   After launching UOS on APL UP2 , 4k monitor cannot be detected.

   **Impact:** UOS hasn't display with 4k monitor.

   **Workaround:** None.

:acrn-issue:`2276` - OVMF failed to launch UOS on UP2.
   UP2 failed to launch UOS using OVMF as virtual bootloader with acrn-dm.

   **Impact:** UOS cannot boot up using OVMF

   **Workaround:** Use VSBL as virtual bootloader

:acrn-issue:`2277` - [APLNUC]Launch UOS with 5G memory will hang 2 minutes
   If launching UOS with 5G memory, there will be about 2 minutes hang.

   **Impact:** Low UOS boot time performance.

   **Workaround:** None.

:acrn-issue:`2278` - [KBLNUC] Cx/Px is not supported on KBLNUC
   C states/P states is not supported on KBL NUC.

   **Impact:** Power Management states related operations cannot be using in SOS/UOS on KBLNUC

   **Workaround:** None

:acrn-issue:`2279` - [APLNUC]After exiting UOS with mediator Usb_KeyBoard and Mouse, SOS cannot use the
   Usb_KeyBoard and Mouse
   After exiting UOS with mediator Usb_KeyBoard and Mouse, SOS cannot use the Usb_KeyBoard and Mouse.
   Reproduce Steps as below:

   1) Insert USB keyboard and mouse in standard A port (USB3.0 port)

   2) Boot UOS by sharing the USB keyboard and mouse in cmd line:
      -s n,xhci,1-1:1-2:1-3:1-4:2-1:2-2:2-3:2-4 \

   3) UOS access USB keyboard and mouse.

   4) Exit UOS.

   5) SOS access USB keyboard and mouse.

   **Impact:** SOS cannot use USB keyboard and mouse in such case.

   **Workaround:** Unplug and plug-in the USB keyboard and mouse after exiting UOS.

:acrn-issue:`2338` - [UP2]Lost 2G memory in SOS when using SBL as bootloader on UP2.
