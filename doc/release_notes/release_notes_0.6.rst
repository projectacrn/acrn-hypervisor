ACRN v0.6 requires Clear Linux OS version 27600.

Version 0.6 New Features
************************

**Enable Privileged VM support for real-time UOS in ACRN**:
Initial patches to enable a User OS
(UOS) running as a virtual machine (VM)
with real-time characteristics, also called a "Privileged VM". We've
published a tutorial.  More patches for ACRN real time support will continue.

**Document updates**: Several new documents have been added in this release, including:

* Running Automotive Grade Linux as a VM
* Using PREEMPT_RT-Linux for real-time UOS
* :ref:`Frequently Asked Questions <faq>`
* :ref:`An introduction to Trusty and Security services on ACRN
  <trusty-security-services>`

:acrn-issue:`1991` - Input is useless in UART Console for corner case
   Input is useless in UART Console for a corner case,
   demonstrated with these steps:

   1) Boot to SOS
   2) ssh into the SOS.
   3) use "./launch_UOS.sh" to boot UOS.
   4) On the host, use "minicom -s dev/ttyUSB0".
   5) Use "sos_console 0" to launch SOS.

   **Impact:** Failed to use UART for input in corner case.

   **Workaround:** Enter other keys before typing :kbd:`Enter`.

:acrn-issue:`1996` - There is an error log when using "acrnd&" to boot UOS
   An error log is printed when starting acrnd as a background job
   (``acrnd&``) to boot UOS. The UOS still boots up
   normally, but prints: "Failed to open the socket(sos-lcs) to query the reason for the wake-up.
   Activating all vms when acrnd & to boot uos."

   **Impact:** UOS boots normally, but prints an error log message.

   **Workaround:** None.

:acrn-issue:`2267` - [APLUP2][LaaG]LaaG can't detect 4k monitor
   After launching UOS on APL UP2 , 4k monitor cannot be detected.

   **Impact:** UOS can't display on a 4k monitor.

   **Workaround:** Use a monitor with less than 4k resolution.

:acrn-issue:`2276` - OVMF failed to launch UOS on UP2.
   UP2 failed to launch UOS using OVMF as virtual bootloader with acrn-dm.

   **Impact:** UOS cannot boot up using OVMF

   **Workaround:** Use VSBL as virtual bootloader

:acrn-issue:`2278` - [KBLNUC] Cx/Px is not supported on KBLNUC
   C states/P states is not supported on KBL NUC.

   **Impact:** Power Management states related operations cannot be using in SOS/UOS on KBLNUC

   **Workaround:** None

:acrn-issue:`2279` - [APLNUC]After exiting UOS with mediator Usb_KeyBoard and Mouse, SOS cannot use the Usb_KeyBoard and Mouse
   After exiting UOS with mediator Usb_KeyBoard and Mouse, SOS cannot use the Usb_KeyBoard and Mouse.
   Reproduce Steps as below:

   1) Insert USB keyboard and mouse in standard A port (USB3.0 port)

   2) Boot UOS by sharing the USB keyboard and mouse in cmd line:

      ``-s n,xhci,1-1:1-2:1-3:1-4:2-1:2-2:2-3:2-4 \``

   3) UOS access USB keyboard and mouse.

   4) Exit UOS.

   5) SOS access USB keyboard and mouse.

   **Impact:** SOS cannot use USB keyboard and mouse in such case.

   **Workaround:** Unplug and plug-in the USB keyboard and mouse after exiting UOS.

:acrn-issue:`2338` - [UP2]Lost 2G memory in SOS when using SBL as bootloader on UP2.
   After using SBL as bootloader to boot UP2, SOS only has 2G memory with 4G physical memory bank.

   **Impact:** lost 2G memory in SOS.

   **Workaround:** Modify SBL Memory setting file "CfgData_Ext_Up2.dlt", see details in issue comments.

:acrn-issue:`2516` - [UP2][SBL] System hang with DP monitor connected
      For UP2, system will occur crash when DP monitor is connected. It will be triggered immediately by running command "cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_display_info" in SOS.

   **Impact:** Cannot use DP monitor.

   **Workaround:** Remove enable_initial_modeset for UP2 platform. You can apply :acrn-commit:`4b53ed67` to rebuild UP2 images.

:acrn-issue:`2522` - [NUC7i7BNH]After starting ias in SOS, there is no display
   On NUC7i7BNH, after starting IAS in SOS, there is no display if the monitor is
   connected with a TPC to VGA connector.

   **Impact:** Special model [NUC7i7BNH] has no display in SOS.

   **Workaround:** None.

:acrn-issue:`2523` - UOS monitor does not display when using IAS
   There is no UOS display after starting IAS weston.

   **Impact:** Cannot use ias weston in UOS.

   **Workaround:**

   1) Use weston instead of IAS weston: ``swupd install x11-server``
   2) Use acrn-kernel to rebuild SOS kernel to replace integrated kernel. To confirm "DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION" related configs in kernel_config_sos should as below:

      .. code-block:: bash

         CONFIG_DRM_KMS_FB_HELPER=y
         CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION=y
         CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_OVERALLOC=100

   The issue will be fixed in the next release.

:acrn-issue:`2524` - [UP2][SBL] Launching UOS hang while weston is running in SOS
   When using weston in SOS, it will hang during the UOS launch.

   **Impact:** launching UOS hang, and then no display in UOS.

   **Workaround:** Use acrn-kernel to rebuild SOS kernel to replace the
   integrated kernel. Confirm "DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION" related
   configs in kernel_config_sos are as below:

   .. code-block:: bash

      CONFIG_DRM_KMS_FB_HELPER=y
      CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION=y
      CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_OVERALLOC=100

   The issue will be fixed in the next release.

:acrn-issue:`2527` - [KBLNUC][HV]System will crash when run crashme (SOS/UOS)
   System will crash after a few minutes running stress test crashme tool in SOS/UOS.

   **Impact:** System may crash in some stress situation.

   **Workaround:** None

:acrn-issue:`2528` - [APLUP2] SBL (built by SBL latest code) failed to boot ACRN hypervisor
   SBL built by latest slimbootloader code (HEAD->ad42a2bd6e4a6364358b9c712cb54e821ee7ee42) failed to boot acrn hypervisor.

   **Impact:** UP2 with SBL cannot boot acrn hypervisor.

   **Workaround:** Use SBL built by earlier slimbootloader code (commit id:edc112328cf3e414523162dd75dc3614e42579fe).
   This folder version can boot acrn hypervisor normally.

.. comment
   Use the syntax:

   :acrn-issue:`663` - Short issue description
     Longer description that helps explain the problem from the user's
     point of view (not internal reasons).  **Impact:** What's the
     consequences of the issue, and how it can affect the user or system.
     **Workaround:** Describe a workaround if one exists (or refer them to the
     :acrn-issue:`663`` if described well there. If no workaround, say
     "none".
