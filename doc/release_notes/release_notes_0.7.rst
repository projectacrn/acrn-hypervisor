ACRN v0.7 (Mar 2019)
####################

We are pleased to announce the release of Project ACRN version 0.7.

ACRN is a flexible, lightweight reference hypervisor, built with
real-time and safety-criticality in mind, optimized to streamline
embedded development through an open source platform. Check out the
:ref:`introduction` for more information.


All project ACRN source code is maintained in the
https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor repository and includes
folders for the ACRN hypervisor, the ACRN device model, tools, and
documentation.  You can either download this source code as a zip or
tar.gz file (see the `ACRN v0.7 GitHub release page
<https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor/releases/tag/v0.7>`_ or
use Git clone and checkout commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor
   cd acrn-hypervisor
   git checkout v0.7

The project's online technical documentation is also tagged to correspond
with a specific release: generated v0.7 documents can be found at
https://projectacrn.github.io/0.7/.  Documentation for the latest
(master) branch is found at https://projectacrn.github.io/latest/.

ACRN v0.7 requires Clear Linux OS version 28260.

Version 0.7 new features
************************

Enable cache QOS with CAT
=========================

Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) is enabled on Apollo Lake (APL)
platforms, providing cache isolation between VMs mainly for real-time
performance quality of service (QoS).  The CAT for a specific VM is
normally set up at boot time per the VM configuration determined at
build time. For debugging and performance tuning, the CAT can also be
enabled and configured at runtime by writing proper values to certain
MSRs using the ``wrmsr`` command on ACRN shell.

Support ACPI power key mediator
===============================
ACRN supports ACPI power/sleep key on the APL and KBL NUC platforms,
triggering S3/S5 flow, following the ACPI spec.

Document updates
================
Several new documents have been added in this release, including:

* ACRN Roadmap: look ahead in 2019
* Performance analysis of VBS-k framework
* HLD design doc for IOC virtualization
* Additional project coding guidelines

Known Issues
************

:acrn-issue:`1773` - USB Mediator: Can't find all devices when multiple USB devices connected [Reproduce rate:60%]
   After booting UOS with multiple USB devices plugged in, there's a 60% chance that one or more devices are not discovered.

   **Impact:** Cannot use multiple USB devices at same time.

   **Workaround:** Unplug and plug-in the unrecognized device after booting.

-----

:acrn-issue:`1991` - Input not accepted in UART Console for corner case
   Input is useless in UART Console for a corner case, demonstrated with these steps:

   1) Boot to SOS
   2) ssh into the SOS.
   3) use ``./launch_UOS.sh`` to boot UOS.
   4) On the host, use ``minicom -s dev/ttyUSB0``.
   5) Use ``sos_console 0`` to launch SOS.

   **Impact:** Fails to use UART for input.

   **Workaround:** Enter other keys before typing :kbd:`Enter`.

-----

:acrn-issue:`1996` - There is an error log when using ``acrnd&`` to boot UOS
   An error log is printed when starting ``acrnd`` as a background job
   (``acrnd&``) to boot UOS. The UOS still boots up
   normally, but prints::

     Failed to open the socket(sos-lcs) to query the reason for the wake-up.
     Activating all vms when acrnd & to boot uos.

   **Impact:** UOS boots normally, but prints an error log message.

   **Workaround:** None.

-----

:acrn-issue:`2267` - [APLUP2][LaaG] LaaG can't detect 4k monitor
   After launching UOS on APL UP2 , 4k monitor cannot be detected.

   **Impact:** UOS can't display on a 4k monitor.

   **Workaround:** Use a monitor with less than 4k resolution.

-----

:acrn-issue:`2278` - [KBLNUC] Cx/Px is not supported on KBLNUC
   C states and P states are not supported on KBL NUC.

   **Impact:** Power Management state-related operations in SOS/UOS on
   KBL NUC can't be used.

   **Workaround:** None

-----

:acrn-issue:`2279` - [APLNUC] After exiting UOS with mediator
   Usb_KeyBoard and Mouse, SOS cannot use the USB keyboard and mouse.

   These steps reproduce the issue:

   1) Insert USB keyboard and mouse in standard A port (USB3.0 port)
   2) Boot UOS by sharing the USB keyboard and mouse in cmd line:

      ``-s n,xhci,1-1:1-2:1-3:1-4:2-1:2-2:2-3:2-4 \``

   3) UOS access USB keyboard and mouse.
   4) Exit UOS.
   5) SOS tries to access USB keyboard and mouse, and fails.

   **Impact:** SOS cannot use USB keyboard and mouse in such case.

   **Workaround:** Unplug and plug-in the USB keyboard and mouse after exiting UOS.

-----

:acrn-issue:`2522` - [NUC7i7BNH] After starting IAS in SOS, there is no display
   On NUC7i7BNH, after starting IAS in SOS, there is no display if the monitor is
   connected with a TPC-to-VGA connector.

   **Impact:** Special model [NUC7i7BNH] has no display in SOS.

   **Workaround:** None.

-----

:acrn-issue:`2523` - UOS monitor does not display when using IAS
   There is no UOS display after starting IAS weston.

   **Impact:** Cannot use IAS weston in UOS.

   **Workaround:**

   1) Use weston instead of IAS weston: ``swupd install x11-server``
   2) Use acrn-kernel to rebuild SOS kernel to replace integrated kernel.
      Confirm "DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION" related configs in kernel_config_sos are:

      .. code-block:: bash

         CONFIG_DRM_KMS_FB_HELPER=y
         CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION=y
         CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_OVERALLOC=100

   The issue will be fixed in the next release.

-----

:acrn-issue:`2524` - [UP2][SBL] Launching UOS hangs while weston is running in SOS
   When using weston in SOS, it will hang during the UOS launch.

   **Impact:** launching UOS hangs, and then no display in UOS.

   **Workaround:** Use acrn-kernel to rebuild SOS kernel to replace the
   integrated kernel. Confirm "DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION" related
   configs in kernel_config_sos are:

   .. code-block:: bash

      CONFIG_DRM_KMS_FB_HELPER=y
      CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION=y
      CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_OVERALLOC=100

   The issue will be fixed in the next release.

-----

:acrn-issue:`2527` - [KBLNUC][HV]System will crash when run ``crashme`` (SOS/UOS)
   System will crash after a few minutes running stress test ``crashme`` tool in SOS/UOS.

   **Impact:** System may crash in some stress situations.

   **Workaround:** None

-----

:acrn-issue:`2526` - Hypervisor crash when booting UOS with acrnlog running with mem loglevel=6
   If we use ``loglevel 3 6`` to change the mem loglevel to 6, we may hit a page fault in HV.

   **Impact:** Hypervisor may crash in some situation.

   **Workaround:** None

-----

:acrn-issue:`2753` - UOS cannot resume after suspend by pressing power key
   UOS cannot resume after suspend by pressing power key

   **Impact:** UOS may failed to resume after suspend by pressing the power key.

   **Workaround:** None


.. comment
   Use the syntax:

   :acrn-issue:`663` - Short issue description
     Longer description that helps explain the problem from the user's
     point of view (not internal reasons).  **Impact:** What's the
     consequences of the issue, and how it can affect the user or system.
     **Workaround:** Describe a workaround if one exists (or refer them to the
     :acrn-issue:`663`` if described well there. If no workaround, say
     "none".
