ACRN v1.0.2 (November 2019)
###########################

We are pleased to announce the release of ACRN version 1.0.2. This is a
maintenance release based on the v1.0 branch that primarily fixes some
potential security and stability issues discovered after the v1.0
release.

ACRN is a flexible, lightweight reference hypervisor that's built with
real-time and safety-criticality in mind and is optimized to streamline
embedded development through an open source platform.  Check out
:ref:`introduction` for more information. All project ACRN source code
is maintained in the https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor
repository and includes folders for the ACRN hypervisor, the ACRN device
model, tools, and documentation. You can either download this source
code as a zip or tar.gz file (see the `ACRN v1.0.2 GitHub release page
<https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor/releases/tag/v1.0.2>`_)
or use the following Git clone and checkout commands::

   $ git clone https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor
   $ cd acrn-hypervisor
   $ git checkout v1.0.2

There were no documentation changes in this update, so you can still
refer to the v1.0-specific documentation found at
https://projectacrn.github.io/1.0/.
