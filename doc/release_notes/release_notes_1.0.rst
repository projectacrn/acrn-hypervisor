Version 1.0 major features
**************************

Hardware Support
================
ACRN supports multiple x86 platforms and has been tested with Apollo
Lake and Kaby Lake NUCs, and the UP Squared board.
(See :ref:`hardware` for supported platform details.)

APL UP2 board with SBL firmware
===============================
ACRN supports APL UP2 board with Slim Bootloader (SBL) firmware.
Slim Bootloader is a modern, flexible, light-weight,
open source reference bootloader that is also  fast, small,
customizable, and secure. An end-to-end reference build has been verified
on UP2/SBL board using ACRN hypervisor, Clear Linux OS as SOS, and Clear
Linux OS as UOS. See the :ref:`using-sbl-up2` for step-by-step instructions.

Enable post-launched RTVM support for real-time UOS in ACRN
===========================================================
This release provides initial patches enabling a User OS (UOS) running as a
virtual machine (VM) with real-time characteristics,
also called a "post-launched RTVM". We've published a tutorial
:ref:`rt_linux_setup`. More patches for ACRN real time support will continue.

Enable cache QOS with CAT
=========================
Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) is available on Apollo Lake (APL) platforms,
providing cache isolation between VMs mainly for real-time performance quality
of service (QoS). The CAT for a specific VM is normally set up at boot time per
the VM configuration determined at build time. For debugging and performance
tuning, the CAT can also be enabled and configured at runtime by writing proper
values to certain MSRs using the ``wrmsr`` command on ACRN shell.

Enable QoS based on runC container
==================================
ACRN supports Device-Model QoS based on runC container to control
the SOS resources (CPU, Storage, MEM, NET) by modifying the runC configuration file,
configuration guide will be published in next release.

S5 support for RTVM
===================
ACRN supports a Real-time VM (RTVM) shutting itself down. A RTVM is a kind
of VM that the SOS can't interfere with at runtime, and as such, only the
RTVM can power itself off internally. All power-off requests external to the
RTVM will be rejected to avoid any interference.

OVMF support initial patches merged in ACRN
===========================================
To support booting Windows as a Guest OS, we are using
Open source Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF). Initial
patches to support OVMF have been merged in ACRN hypervisor. More patches for
ACRN and patches upstreaming to OVMF work will be continuing.

Support ACPI power key mediator
===============================
ACRN supports ACPI power/sleep key on the APL and KBL NUC platforms, triggering
S3/S5 flow, following the ACPI spec.

VT-x, VT-d
==========
Based on Intel VT-x virtualization technology, ACRN emulates a virtual CPU
with core partitioning. VT-d provides hardware support
for isolating and restricting device accesses to only the owner of the
partition managing the device. It allows assigning I/O devices to a VM,
and extending the protection and isolation properties of VMs for
I/O operations.

PIC/IOAPIC/MSI/MSI-X/PCI/LAPIC
==============================
ACRN hypervisor supports virtualized APIC-V, EPT, IOAPIC, and LAPIC functionality.

Ethernet
========
ACRN hypervisor supports virtualized Ethernet functionality. The Ethernet
Mediator is executed in the Service OS and provides packet forwarding between
the physical networking devices (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.) and virtual devices in
the Guest VMs (also called "User OS"). The HW platform physical connection can be shared
with Linux, Android by Service OS guests for regular (i.e. non-AVB) traffic.

Mass Storage
============
ACRN hypervisor supports virtualized non-volatile R/W storage for the Service
OS and Guest OS instances, supporting VM private storage and/or storage shared
between Guest OS instances.

USB (xDCI)
==========
ACRN hypervisor supports pass-through of xDCI
controllers to a Guest OS from the platform.

USB Mediator (xHCI)
===================
ACRN hypervisor supports an emulated USB xHCI controller for Guest OS.
(See :ref:`usb_virtualization` for more information.)

Wi-Fi
=====
ACRN hypervisor supports doing a pass-through of the Wi-Fi chip to
a Guest VM (UOS), enables control of the Wi-Fi as an in-vehicle hotspot for third-party
devices, provides third-party device applications access to the vehicle, and
provides access of third-party devices to the TCU (if applicable) provided connectivity.

IPU (MIPI CSI-2, HDMI-in)
=========================
ACRN hypervisor provide an IPU mediator to share with Guest OS. Alternatively, IPU
can also be configured as pass-through to Guest OS without sharing.

Bluetooth
=========
ACRN hypervisor supports Bluetooth controller passthrough to a single Guest
OS (for example, for In-Vehicle Infotainment or IVI use cases).

GVT-g for ACRN
==============
GVT-g for ACRN (a.k.a AcrnGT) is a feature to enable GPU sharing Service OS
and User OS, so both can run GPU workload simultaneously. Direct display is
supported by AcrnGT, where the Service OS and User OS are each assigned to
a different display. The display ports support eDP and HDMI. See :ref:`APL_GVT-g-hld`
for more information.

GPU - Preemption
================
GPU Preemption is one typical automotive use case which requires the system
to preempt GPU resources occupied by lower priority workloads. This is done
to ensure performance of the most critical workload can be achieved. Three
different schedulers for the GPU are involved: i915 UOS scheduler, Mediator
GVT scheduler, and i915 SOS scheduler.

GPU - display surface sharing via Hyper DMA
===========================================
Surface sharing is one typical automotive use case which requires that the
SOS accesses an individual surface or a set of surfaces from the UOS without
having to access the entire frame buffer of the UOS. It leverages hyper_DMABUF,
a Linux kernel driver running on multiple VMs and expands DMA-BUFFER sharing
capability to inter-VM.

Virtio standard is supported
============================
Virtio framework is widely used in ACRN, allowing devices beyond network and
storage to be shared to UOS in a standard way. Many mediators in ACRN follow
the virtio spec. Virtio-based virtualization is called para-virtualization.
Virtio is a virtualization standard for network and disk device drivers where
the guest's device driver "knows" it is running in a virtual environment, and
cooperates with the hypervisor. The SOS and UOS can share physical LAN network
and physical eMMC storage device. (See :ref:`virtio-hld` for more information.)

Device pass-through support
===========================
Device pass-through to UOS supported with help of VT-d.

GPIO virtualization
===================
GPIO virtualization is supported as para-virtualization based on the Virtual
I/O Device (VIRTIO) specification. The GPIO consumers of the Front-end are able
to set or get GPIO values, directions, and configuration via one virtual GPIO
controller. In the Back-end, the GPIO command line in the launch script can be
modified to map native GPIO to UOS. (See :ref:`virtio-hld` for more information.)

New ACRN tools
==============
We've added a collection of support tools including ``acrnctl``, ``acrntrace``, ``acrnlog``,
``acrn-crashlog``, ``acrnprobe``. (See :ref:`tools` for details.)
