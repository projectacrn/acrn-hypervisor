ACRN v2.6 (Sep 2021) - Draft
############################

We are pleased to announce the release of the Project ACRN hypervisor
version 2.6.

ACRN is a flexible, lightweight reference hypervisor that is built with
real-time and safety-criticality in mind. It is optimized to streamline
embedded development through an open-source platform. See the
:ref:`introduction` introduction for more information.

All project ACRN source code is maintained in the
https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor repository and includes
folders for the ACRN hypervisor, the ACRN device model, tools, and
documentation. You can either download this source code as a zip or
tar.gz file (see the `ACRN v2.6 GitHub release page
<https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor/releases/tag/v2.6>`_) or
use Git ``clone`` and ``checkout`` commands::

   git clone https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor
   cd acrn-hypervisor
   git checkout v2.6

The project's online technical documentation is also tagged to
correspond with a specific release: generated v2.6 documents can be
found at https://projectacrn.github.io/2.6/.  Documentation for the
latest under-development branch is found at
https://projectacrn.github.io/latest/.

ACRN v2.6 requires Ubuntu 18.04.  Follow the instructions in the
:ref:`gsg` to get started with ACRN.
