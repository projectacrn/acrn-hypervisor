ACRN Configuration Tool
#######################

The ACRN configuration tool is designed for System Integrators / Tier 1s to
customize ACRN to meet their own needs. It consists of two tools, the
``Kconfig`` tool and the ``acrn-config`` tool. The latter allows users to provision
VMs via a web interface and configure the hypervisor from XML files at build time.

Introduction
************

ACRN includes three types of configurations: Hypervisor, Board, and VM. Each
are discussed in the following sections.

Hypervisor configuration
========================

The hypervisor configuration selects a working scenario and target
board by configuring the hypervisor image features and capabilities such as
setting up the log and the serial port.

The hypervisor configuration uses the ``Kconfig`` ``make
menuconfig`` mechanism.  The configuration file is located at::

   acrn-hypervisor/hypervisor/arch/x86/configs/Kconfig

A board-specific ``defconfig`` file, located at::

   acrn-hypervisor/hypervisor/arch/x86/configs/$(BOARD)/$(BOARD).config

is loaded first; it is the default ``Kconfig`` for the specified board.

Board configuration
===================

The board configuration stores board-specific settings referenced by the
ACRN hypervisor. This includes **scenario-relevant** information such as
board settings, root device selection, and the kernel cmdline. It also includes
**scenario-irrelevant** hardware-specific information such as ACPI/PCI
and BDF information. The board configuration is organized as
``*.c/*.h`` files located at::

   acrn-hypervisor/hypervisor/arch/x86/$(BOARD)/

VM configuration
=================

VM configuration includes **scenario-based** VM configuration
information that is used to describe the characteristics and attributes for
VMs on each user scenario. It also includes **launch script-based** VM
configuration information, where parameters are passed to the device model
to launch post-launched User VMs.

Scenario based VM configurations are organized as ``*.c/*.h`` files located at::

   acrn-hypervisor/hypervisor/scenarios/$(SCENARIO)/

User VM launch script samples are located at::

   acrn-hypervisor/devicemodel/samples/

ACRN configuration XMLs
***********************

The ACRN configuration includes three kinds of XMLs for acrn-config usage:
``board``, ``scenario``, and ``launch`` XML. All scenario-irrelevant
hardware-specific information for the board configuration is
stored in the ``board`` XML. The XML is generated by ``misc/acrn-config/target/board_parser.py``
which runs on the target board. The scenario-relevant board and
scenario-based VM
configurations are stored in the ``scenario`` XML. The launch script-based VM
configuration is stored in the ``launch`` XML. These two XMLs can be customized
by using the web inteface tool at ``misc/acrn-config/config-app/app.py``. End users can load
their own configurations by importing customized XMLs or by saving the
configurations by exporting XMLs.


Board XML format
================

The board XML has an ``acrn-config`` root element and a ``board`` attribute:

.. code-block:: xml

   <acrn-config board=”BOARD”>

As an input for the ``acrn-config`` tool, end users do not need to care about the format of board XML and should not modify it.

Scenario XML format
===================

The scenario XML has an ``acrn-config`` root element as well as ``board`` and ``scenario`` attributes:

.. code-block:: xml

   <acrn-config board=”BOARD” scenario=”SCENARIO”>

Additional scenario XML elements:

``vm``: Specify the VM with VMID by its "id" attribute.

``load_order``: Specify the VM by its load order: PRE_LAUNCHED_VM, SOS_VM or POST_LAUNCHED_VM.

``name`` under parent of ``vm``: Specify the VM name which will be shown in the hypervisor console command: vm_list.

``uuid``: UUID of the VM. It is for internal use and is not configurable.

``guest_flags``: Select all applicable flags for the VM.

``vcpu_affinity``: vCPU affinity map; Each vCPU will pin to the selected pCPU ID and different vCPU should not pin to same pCPU.

``size`` under parent of ``epc_section``: SGX EPC section base; must be page aligned.

``base`` under parent of ``epc_section``: SGX EPC section size in Bytes; must be page aligned.

``clos``: Class of Service for Cache Allocation Technology. Refer to the SDM 17.19.2 for details and use with caution.

``start_hpa``: The start physical address in host for the VM.

``size`` under parent of ``memory``: The memory size in Bytes for the VM.

``name`` under parent of ``os_config``: Specify the OS name of VM; currently, it is not referenced by the hypervisor code.

``kern_type``: Specify the kernel image type so that the hypervisor can load it correctly. Currently supports KERNEL_BZIMAGE and KERNEL_ZEPHYR.

``kern_mod``: The tag for the kernel image that acts as a multiboot module; it must exactly match the module tag in the GRUB multiboot cmdline.

``bootargs`` under parent of ``os_config``: For internal use and is not configurable. Specify the kernel boot arguments in bootargs under the parent of board_private.

``vuart``: Specify the vuart (A.K.A COM) with the vUART ID by its "id" attribute. Refer to :ref:`vuart_config` for detailed vUART settings.

``type`` under parent of ``vuart``: vUART (A.K.A COM) type, currently only supports the legacy PIO mode.

``base`` under parent of ``vuart``: vUART (A.K.A COM) enabling switch. Enable by exposing its COM_BASE (SOS_COM_BASE for Service VM); disable by returning INVALID_COM_BASE.

``irq`` under parent of ``vuart``: vCOM irq.

``target_vm_id``: COM2 is used for VM communications. When it is enabled, specify which target VM the current VM connects to.

``target_uart_id``: Target vUART ID that vCOM2 connects to.

``pci_dev_num``: PCI devices number of the VM; it is hard-coded for each scenario so it is not configurable for now.

``pci_devs``: PCI devices list of the VM; it is hard-coded for each scenario so it is not configurable for now.

``board_private``: Stores scenario-relevant board configuration.

``rootfs``: rootfs for the Linux kernel.

``console``: ttyS console for the Linux kernel.

``bootargs`` under parent of ``board_private``: Specify kernel boot arguments.

Launch XML format
=================

The launch XML has an ``acrn-config`` root element as well as
``board``, ``scenario`` and ``uos_launcher`` attributes:

.. code-block:: xml

   <acrn-config board="BOARD" scenario="SCENARIO" uos_launcher="UOS_NUMBER">

Attributes of the ``uos_launcher`` specify the number of User VMs that the current scenario has:

``uos``: Specify the User VM with its relative ID to Service VM by the "id" attribute.

``uos_type``: Specify the User VM type, such as  CLEARLINUX, ANDROID, or VXWORKS.

``rtos_type``: Specify the User VM Realtime capability: Soft RT, Hard RT, or none of them.

``cpu_num``: Specify the max cpu number for the VM.

``mem_size``: Specify the User VM memory size in Mbyte.

``gvt_args``: GVT argument for the VM.

``vbootloader``: Virtual bootloader type; currently only supports OVMF.

``rootfs_dev``: The device where User VM rootfs located.

``rootfs_img``: User VM rootfs image file including path.

``console_type``: Specify whether the User VM console is virtio or vUART; refer to :ref:`vuart_config` for details.

``poweroff_channel``: Specify whether the User VM power off channel is through the IOC, Powerbutton, or vUART.

``passthrough_devices``: Select the passthrough device from the lspci list; currently we support: usb_xdci, audio, audio_codec, ipu, ipu_i2c, cse, wifi, Bluetooth, sd_card, ethernet, wifi, sata, and nvme.

.. note::

   The ``configurable`` and ``readonly`` attributes are used to mark whether the items is configurable for users. When ``configurable=”0”`` and ``readonly=”true”``, the item is not configurable from the web interface. When ``configurable=“0”``. the item does not appear on the interface.

Configuration tool workflow
***************************

Hypervisor configuration workflow
==================================

The hypervisor configuration is based on the ``Kconfig`` ``make menuconfig``
mechanism. Begin by creating a board-specific ``defconfig`` file to
set up the default ``Kconfig`` values for the specified board.
Next, configure the hypervisor build options using the ``make
menuconfig`` graphical interface. The resulting ``.config`` file is
used by the ACRN build process to create a configured scenario- and
board-specific hypervisor image.

Board and VM configuration workflow
===================================

Python offline tools are provided to configure Board and VM configurations.
The tool source folder is located at::

   acrn-hypervisor/misc/acrn-config/

Here is the offline configuration tool workflow:

#. Get the board info.

   a. Set up a native Linux environment on the target board.
   #. Copy the ``target`` folder into the target file system and then run the
      ``sudo python3 board_parser.py $(BOARD)`` command.
   #. A $(BOARD).xml that includes all needed hardware-specific information
      is generated in the ``./out/`` folder. (Here ``$(BOARD)`` is the
      specified board name)

      | **Native Linux requirement:**
      | **Release:** Ubuntu 18.04+ or Clear Linux 30210+
      | **Tools:** cpuid, rdmsr, lspci, dmidecode (optional)
      | **Kernel cmdline:** "idle=nomwait intel_idle.max_cstate=0 intel_pstate=disable"

#. Customize your needs.

   a. Copy ``$(BOARD).xml`` to the host development machine.
   #. Run the ``misc/acrn-config/config-app/app.py`` tool on the host machine and import the $(BOARD).xml. Select your working scenario under  **Scenario Setting** and input the desired scenario settings. The tool will do a sanity check on the input based on the $(BOARD).xml. The customized settings can be exported to your own $(SCENARIO).xml.
   #. In the configuration tool UI, input the launch script parameters for the post-launched User VM under **Launch Setting**. The tool will sanity check the input based on both the $(BOARD).xml and $(SCENARIO).xml and then export settings to your $(LAUNCH).xml.
   #. The user defined XMLs can be imported by acrn-config for modification.

 .. note:: Refer to :ref:`acrn_config_tool_ui` for more details on
      the configuration tool UI.

3. Auto generate the code.

   Python tools are used to generate configurations in patch format.
   The patches are applied to your local ``acrn-hypervisor`` git tree
   automatically.

   a. Generate a patch for the board-related configuration::

         cd misc/board_config
         python3 board_cfg_gen.py --board $(BOARD).xml --scenario $(SCENARIO).xml

      Note that this can also be done by clicking **Generate Board SRC** in the acrn-config UI.


   #. Generate a patch for scenario-based VM configuration::

         cd misc/scenario_config
         python3 scenario_cfg_gen.py --board $(BOARD).xml --scenario $(SCENARIO).xml

      Note that this can also be done by clicking **Generate Scenario SRC** in the acrn-config UI.

   #. Generate the launch script for the specified
      post-launch User VM::

         cd misc/launch_config
         python3 launch_cfg_gen.py --board $(BOARD).xml --scenario $(SCENARIO).xml --launch $(LAUNCH).xml

      Note that this can also be done by clicking **Generate Launch Script** in the acrn-config UI.

#. Re-build the ACRN hypervisor. Refer to
   :ref:`getting-started-building` to re-build the ACRN hypervisor on the host machine.

#. Deploy VMs and run ACRN hypervisor on the target board.

Use the ACRN configuration app
******************************

The ACRN configuration app is a web user interface application that performs the following:
- reads board info
- configures and validates scenario settings
- automatically generates patches for board-related configurations and
scenario-based VM configurations
- configures and validates launch settings
- generates launch scripts for the specified post-launched User VMs.

Prerequisites
=============

.. _get acrn repo guide:
   https://projectacrn.github.io/latest/getting-started/building-from-source.html#get-the-acrn-hypervisor-source-code

- Follow the :ref:`instruction <getting-started-building>` to install the
  ACRN hypervisor dependencies and tools on your development host.

- Follow the `get acrn repo guide`_ to download the ACRN hypervisor repo to your host.

- Install ACRN configuration app dependencies:

  .. code-block:: none

     $ cd ~/acrn-hypervisor/misc/acrn-config/config_app
     $ sudo pip3 install -r requirements

Instructions
============

#. Launch the ACRN configuration app:

   .. code-block:: none

      $ python3 app.py

#. Open a browser and navigate to the website
   `<http://127.0.0.1:5001/>`_ automatically, or you may need to visit this website manually. Make sure you can connect to open network from browser because the app needs to download some javascript files.

   .. note:: The ACRN configuration app is supported on Chrome, Firefox, and MS Edge, do not use IE.

   The website is shown below:

   .. figure:: images/config_app_main_menu.png
      :align: center
      :name: ACRN config tool main menu

#. Set the board info:

   a. Click **Import Board info**.

      .. figure:: images/click_import_board_info_button.png
         :align: center

   #. Upload the board info you have generated from the ACRN config tool.

   #. After board info is uploaded, you will see the board name from the Board info list. Select the board name to be configured.

      .. figure:: images/select_board_info.png
         :align: center

#. Choose a scenario from the **Scenario Setting** menu which lists all the scenarios,
   including the efault scenarios and the user-defined scenarios for the board you selected
   in the previous step. The scenario configuration xmls are located at
   ``acrn-hypervisor/misc/xmls/config-xmls/[board]/``.

   .. figure:: images/choose_scenario.png
      :align: center

   Note that you can also use a customized scenario xml by clicking **Import**.
   The configuration app automatically directs to the new scenario xml once the import is complete.

#. The configurable items display after one scenario is selected. Here is
   the example of "SDC" scenario:

   .. figure:: images/configure_scenario.png
      :align: center

   - You can edit these items directly in the text boxes, cor you can choose single or even multiple
     items from the drop down list.

   - Read-only items are marked as grey.

   - Hover the mouse pointer over the item to display the description.

#. Click **Export** to save the scenario xml; you can rename it in the pop-up modal.

   .. note:: All customized scenario xmls will be in user-defined groups which located in
      ``acrn-hypervisor/misc/xmls/config-xmls/[board]/user_defined/``.

   Before saving the scenario xml, the configuration app will validate the configurable items. If errors exist, the configuration app lists all wrong configurable items and shows the errors as below:

   .. figure:: images/err_acrn_configuration.png
      :align: center

   After the scenario is saved, the page automatically directs to the saved scenario xmls.
   You can delete the configured scenario by clicking **Export** -> **Remove**.

#. Click **Generate Board SRC** to save the current scenario setting and then generate
   a patch for the board-related configuration source codes in
   ``acrn-hypervisor/hypervisor/arch/x86/configs/[board]/``.

#. Click **Generate Scenario SRC** to save the current scenario setting and then generate
   a patch for the scenario-based VM configuration scenario source codes in
   ``acrn-hypervisor/hypervisor/scenarios/[scenario]/``.

The **Launch Setting** is quite similar to the **Scenario Setting**:

#. Upload board info or select one board as the current board.

#. Import your local launch setting xml by clicking **Import** or selecting one launch setting xml from the menu.

#. Select one scenario for the current launch setting from the **Select Scenario** drop down box.

#. Configure the items for the current launch setting.

#. Save the current launch setting to the user-defined xml files by clicking **Export**. The configuration app validates the current configuration and lists all wrong configurable items and shows errors.

#. Click **Generate Launch Script** to save the current launch setting and then generate the launch script.
