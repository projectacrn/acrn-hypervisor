ACRN Configuration Tool
#######################

The ACRN configuration tool is designed for System Integrators / Tier 1s to
customize ACRN to meet their own needs. It consists of two tools, the
``Kconfig`` tool and the ``acrn-config`` tool. The latter allows users to provision
VMs via a web interface and configure the hypervisor from XML files at build time.

Introduction
************

ACRN includes three types of configurations: Hypervisor, Board, and VM. Each
are discussed in the following sections.

Hypervisor configuration
========================

The hypervisor configuration selects a working scenario and target
board by configuring the hypervisor image features and capabilities such as
setting up the log and the serial port.

The hypervisor configuration uses the ``Kconfig`` ``make
menuconfig`` mechanism.  The configuration file is located in the
``acrn-hypervisor/hypervisor/arch/x86/configs/`` folder.

The board-specific ``defconfig`` file,
``acrn-hypervisor/hypervisor/arch/x86/configs/$(BOARD).config``
is loaded first; it is the default ``Kconfig`` for the specified board.

Board configuration
===================

The board configuration stores board-specific settings referenced by the
ACRN hypervisor. This includes **scenario-relevant** information such as
board settings, root device selection, and the kernel cmdline. It also includes
**scenario-irrelevant** hardware-specific information such as ACPI/PCI
and BDF information. The board configuration is organized as
``*.c/*.h`` files located in the
``acrn-hypervisor/hypervisor/arch/x86/configs/$(BOARD)/`` folder.

VM configuration
=================

VM configuration includes **scenario-based** VM configuration
information that is used to describe the characteristics and attributes for
VMs on each user scenario. It also includes **launch script-based** VM
configuration information, where parameters are passed to the device model
to launch post-launched User VMs.

Scenario based VM configurations are organized as ``*.c/*.h`` files
located in the ``acrn-hypervisor/hypervisor/scenarios/$(SCENARIO)/``
folder.

User VM launch script samples are located in the
``acrn-hypervisor/devicemodel/samples/`` folder.

ACRN configuration XMLs
***********************

The ACRN configuration includes three kinds of XML files for acrn-config
usage: ``board``, ``scenario``, and ``launch`` XML. All
scenario-irrelevant hardware-specific information for the board
configuration is stored in the ``board`` XML. The XML is generated by
``misc/acrn-config/target/board_parser.py``, which runs on the target
board. The scenario-relevant board and scenario-based VM configurations
are stored in the ``scenario`` XML. The launch script-based VM
configuration is stored in the ``launch`` XML. These two XMLs can be
customized by using the web interface tool at
``misc/acrn-config/config_app/app.py``. End users can load their own
configurations by importing customized XMLs or by saving the
configurations by exporting XMLs.


Board XML format
================

The board XMLs are located in the
``acrn-hypervisor/misc/acrn-config/xmls/board-xmls/`` folder.
The board XML has an ``acrn-config`` root element and a ``board`` attribute:

.. code-block:: xml

   <acrn-config board="BOARD">

As an input for the ``acrn-config`` tool, end users do not need to care
about the format of board XML and should not modify it.

Scenario XML format
===================
The scenario XMLs are located in the
``acrn-hypervisor/misc/acrn-config/xmls/config-xmls/`` folder.  The
scenario XML has an ``acrn-config`` root element as well as ``board``
and ``scenario`` attributes:

   and ``readonly="true"``, the item is not configurable from the web
   interface. When ``configurable="0"``. the item does not appear on the
   interface.

Configuration tool workflow
***************************

Hypervisor configuration workflow
==================================

The hypervisor configuration is based on the ``Kconfig`` ``make menuconfig``
mechanism. Begin by creating a board-specific ``defconfig`` file to
set up the default ``Kconfig`` values for the specified board.
Next, configure the hypervisor build options using the ``make
menuconfig`` graphical interface. The resulting ``.config`` file is
used by the ACRN build process to create a configured scenario- and
board-specific hypervisor image.

.. _vm_config_workflow:

Board and VM configuration workflow
===================================

Python offline tools are provided to configure Board and VM configurations.
The tool source folder is ``acrn-hypervisor/misc/acrn-config/``.

Here is the offline configuration tool workflow:

#. Get the board info.

   a. Set up a native Linux environment on the target board.
   #. Copy the ``target`` folder into the target file system and then run the
      ``sudo python3 board_parser.py $(BOARD)`` command.
   #. A $(BOARD).xml that includes all needed hardware-specific information
      is generated in the ``./out/`` folder. (Here ``$(BOARD)`` is the
      specified board name)

      | **Native Linux requirement:**
      | **Release:** Ubuntu 18.04+ or Clear Linux 30210+
      | **Tools:** cpuid, rdmsr, lspci, dmidecode (optional)
      | **Kernel cmdline:** "idle=nomwait intel_idle.max_cstate=0 intel_pstate=disable"

#. Customize your needs.

   a. Copy ``$(BOARD).xml`` to the host development machine.
   #. Run the ``misc/acrn-config/config_app/app.py`` tool on the host
      machine and import the $(BOARD).xml. Select your working scenario under
      **Scenario Setting** and input the desired scenario settings. The tool
      will do a sanity check on the input based on the $(BOARD).xml. The
      customized settings can be exported to your own $(SCENARIO).xml.
   #. In the configuration tool UI, input the launch script parameters
      for the post-launched User VM under **Launch Setting**. The tool will
      sanity check the input based on both the $(BOARD).xml and
      $(SCENARIO).xml and then export settings to your $(LAUNCH).xml.
   #. The user defined XMLs can be imported by acrn-config for modification.

   .. note:: Refer to :ref:`acrn_config_tool_ui` for more details on
      the configuration tool UI.

3. Auto generate the code.

   Python tools are used to generate configurations in patch format.
   The patches are applied to your local ``acrn-hypervisor`` git tree
   automatically.

   a. Generate a patch for the board-related configuration::

         cd misc/acrn-config/board_config
         python3 board_cfg_gen.py --board $(BOARD).xml --scenario $(SCENARIO).xml

      Note that this can also be done by clicking **Generate Board SRC** in the acrn-config UI.


   #. Generate a patch for scenario-based VM configuration::

         cd misc/acrn-config/scenario_config
         python3 scenario_cfg_gen.py --board $(BOARD).xml --scenario $(SCENARIO).xml

      Note that this can also be done by clicking **Generate Scenario SRC** in the acrn-config UI.

   #. Generate the launch script for the specified
      post-launched User VM::

         cd misc/acrn-config/launch_config
         python3 launch_cfg_gen.py --board $(BOARD).xml --scenario $(SCENARIO).xml --launch $(LAUNCH).xml --uosid xx

      Note that this can also be done by clicking **Generate Launch Script** in the acrn-config UI.

#. Re-build the ACRN hypervisor. Refer to
   :ref:`getting-started-building` to re-build the ACRN hypervisor on the host machine.

#. Deploy VMs and run ACRN hypervisor on the target board.

Use the ACRN configuration app
******************************

The ACRN configuration app is a web user interface application that performs the following:

- reads board info
- configures and validates scenario settings
- automatically generates patches for board-related configurations and
  scenario-based VM configurations
- configures and validates launch settings
- generates launch scripts for the specified post-launched User VMs.

Prerequisites
=============

.. _get acrn repo guide:
   https://projectacrn.github.io/latest/getting-started/building-from-source.html#get-the-acrn-hypervisor-source-code

- Clone acrn-hypervisor:

  .. code-block:: none

     $git clone https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor

- Install ACRN configuration app dependencies:

  .. code-block:: none

     $ cd ~/acrn-hypervisor/misc/acrn-config/config_app
     $ sudo pip3 install -r requirements


Instructions
============

#. Launch the ACRN configuration app:

   .. code-block:: none

      $ python3 app.py

#. Open a browser and navigate to the website
   `<http://127.0.0.1:5001/>`_ automatically, or you may need to visit this
   website manually. Make sure you can connect to open network from browser
   because the app needs to download some JavaScript files.

   .. note:: The ACRN configuration app is supported on Chrome, Firefox,
      and MS Edge. Do not use IE.

   The website is shown below:

   .. figure:: images/config_app_main_menu.png
      :align: center
      :name: ACRN config tool main menu

#. Set the board info:

   a. Click **Import Board info**.

      .. figure:: images/click_import_board_info_button.png
         :align: center

   #. Upload the board info you have generated from the ACRN config tool.

   #. After board info is uploaded, you will see the board name from the Board
      info list. Select the board name to be configured.

      .. figure:: images/select_board_info.png
         :align: center

#. Choose a scenario from the **Scenario Setting** menu which lists all the scenarios,
   including the default scenarios and the user-defined scenarios for the board you selected
   in the previous step. The scenario configuration xmls are located at
   ``acrn-hypervisor/misc/acrn-config/xmls/config-xmls/[board]/``.

   .. figure:: images/choose_scenario.png
      :align: center

   Note that you can also use a customized scenario xml by clicking **Import**.
   The configuration app automatically directs to the new scenario xml once the import is complete.

#. The configurable items display after one scenario is selected. Here is
   the example of "SDC" scenario:

   .. figure:: images/configure_scenario.png
      :align: center

   - You can edit these items directly in the text boxes, cor you can choose single or even multiple
     items from the drop down list.

   - Read-only items are marked as grey.

   - Hover the mouse pointer over the item to display the description.

#. Click **Export** to save the scenario xml; you can rename it in the pop-up modal.

   .. note:: All customized scenario xmls will be in user-defined groups which located in
      ``acrn-hypervisor/misc/acrn-config/xmls/config-xmls/[board]/user_defined/``.

   Before saving the scenario xml, the configuration app will validate
   the configurable items. If errors exist, the configuration app lists all
   wrong configurable items and shows the errors as below:

   .. figure:: images/err_acrn_configuration.png
      :align: center

   After the scenario is saved, the page automatically directs to the saved scenario xmls.
   You can delete the configured scenario by clicking **Export** -> **Remove**.

#. Click **Generate Board SRC** to save the current scenario setting and then generate
   a patch for the board-related configuration source codes in
   ``acrn-hypervisor/hypervisor/arch/x86/configs/[board]/``.

#. Click **Generate Scenario SRC** to save the current scenario setting and then generate
   a patch for the scenario-based VM configuration scenario source codes in
   ``acrn-hypervisor/hypervisor/scenarios/[scenario]/``.

The **Launch Setting** is quite similar to the **Scenario Setting**:

#. Upload board info or select one board as the current board.

#. Import your local launch setting xml by clicking **Import** or selecting one launch setting xml from the menu.

#. Select one scenario for the current launch setting from the **Select Scenario** drop down box.

#. Configure the items for the current launch setting.

#. Save the current launch setting to the user-defined xml files by
   clicking **Export**. The configuration app validates the current
   configuration and lists all wrong configurable items and shows errors.

#. Click **Generate Launch Script** to save the current launch setting and then generate the launch script.
