ACRN Configurator Tool

This guide describes all features and uses of the tool.

About the ACRN Configurator Tool
*********************************

The ACRN configurator tool ``acrn_configurator.py`` provides a web-based
user interface to help you customize your
:ref:`ACRN configuration <acrn_configuration_tool>`. Capabilities:

- reads board information from the specified board configuration file
- provides a GUI to help you configure and validate scenario and
  launch configuration files
- generates launch scripts for the specified post-launched User VMs
- dynamically creates a new scenario configuration and adds or deletes VM
  settings in it
- dynamically creates a new launch configuration and adds or deletes User VM
  settings in it

The tool guides you to configure ACRN in a particular order, due to
dependencies among the different types of configuration files. Here's an
overview of what to expect:

#. Import the board configuration file that you generated via the
   :ref:`board inspector tool <board_inspector_tool>`.

#. Customize your scenario configuration file by defining hypervisor and
   VM settings that will be used to build the ACRN hypervisor.

#. If your scenario has post-launched User VMs, customize launch scripts
   that the Service VM will use to create the VMs
   and allocate resources to them dynamically at runtime.
   Customizing launch scripts involves these steps:

   a. Configure settings for all post-launched User VMs in your scenario
      and save the configuration in a launch configuration file.

   #. Generate the launch scripts. The ACRN configurator creates one
      launch script for each VM defined in the launch configuration file.

Generate a Scenario Configuration File and Launch Scripts
*********************************************************

The following steps describe all options in the ACRN configurator for generating
a custom scenario configuration file and launch scripts.

#. Make sure the development computer is set up and ready to launch the ACRN
   configurator, according to :ref:`gsg-dev-setup` in the Getting Started Guide.

#. Launch the ACRN configurator. This example assumes the tool is in the
   ``~/acrn-work/`` directory. Feel free to modify the command as needed.

   .. code-block:: bash

      python3 ~/acrn-work/acrn-hypervisor/misc/config_tools/config_app/acrn_configurator.py

#. Your web browser should open the website `<http://127.0.0.1:5001/>`_
   automatically, or you may need to visit this website manually. The ACRN
   configurator is supported on Chrome and Firefox.

#. Click the **Import Board XML** button and browse to your board
   configuration file. After the file is uploaded, make sure the board name
   is selected in the **Board info** drop-down list and the board information
   appears.

#. Start the scenario configuration process by selecting an option from the
   **Scenario Settings** menu on the top banner of the UI or by importing a
   scenario configuration file via the **Import XML** button. The four options
   are described below:

   * Click **Create a new scenario** from the **Scenario Settings** menu to
     dynamically create a new scenario configuration for the current board.

   * Click **Load a default scenario** from the **Scenario Settings** menu to
     select a :ref:`predefined scenario configuration <usage-scenarios>`.

   * Click the **Scenario Settings** menu and select a scenario from the list
     under **scenario setting list**.

   .. image:: images/choose_scenario.png
      :align: center

   * Click the **Import XML** button to import a customized scenario
     configuration file.
     The file must be one that was written for the current board. Any mismatch
     in the board name and the one found in the scenario configuration file you
     are trying to import will lead to an error message.

#. When the scenario configuration file is available for editing, the
   configurable items appear below the **Scenario Setting** row. You may
   need to scroll down to see them. Example:

   .. image:: images/configure_scenario.png
      :align: center

   * You can edit these items directly in the text boxes, or you can choose
     single or even multiple items from the drop-down list.

   * Read-only items are marked as gray.

   * Hover the mouse cursor over the item to see the description.

#. Add or delete VMs:

   * Click **Add a VM below** in a VM's settings, and then select a VM type
     to add a new VM under the current VM.

   * Click **Remove this VM** in a VM's settings to remove the VM from the
     scenario.

   When a VM is added or removed, the configurator reassigns the VM IDs for
   the remaining VMs by the order of pre-launched User VMs, Service VM, and
   post-launched User VMs.

#. Click **Export XML** to save the scenario configuration file. A dialog box
   appears, enabling you to save the file to a specific folder by inputting the
   absolute path to this folder. If you don't specify a path, the file will be
   saved to the default folder: ``acrn-hypervisor/../user_config/<board name>``.

   Before saving the scenario configuration file, the configurator validates
   the configurable items. If errors exist, the configurator lists all
   incorrectly configured items and shows the errors. Example:

   .. image:: images/err_acrn_configuration.png
      :align: center

   After the scenario is saved, the page automatically displays the saved
   scenario configuration file.

#. To delete a scenario configuration file, click **Export XML** > **Remove**.
   The configurator will delete the loaded file, even if you change the name of
   the file in the dialog box.

#. If your scenario has post-launched User VMs, continue to the next step
   to create launch scripts for those VMs. If your scenario doesn't have
   post-launched User VMs, you can skip to the final step to close the tool.

#. Start the launch script configuration process by
   selecting an option from the **Launch Settings** menu on the top banner of
   the UI or by importing a launch configuration file via the **Import XML**
   button. The four options are described below:

   * Click **Create a new launch script** from the **Launch Settings** menu to
     dynamically create a new launch configuration for the current board.

   * Click **Load a default launch script** from the **Launch Settings** menu to
     select a predefined launch configuration.

   * Click the **Launch Settings** menu and select a launch configuration
     from the list under **launch setting list**.

   .. image:: images/choose_launch.png
      :align: center

   * Click the **Import XML** button to import a customized launch
     configuration file.

#. Select a scenario for the current launch configuration from the
   **Select Scenario** drop-down box.

#. When the launch configuration file is available for editing, the
   configurable items appear below the **Launch Setting** row. You may need
   to scroll down to see them. Example:

   .. image:: images/configure_launch.png
      :align: center

   * You can edit these items directly in the text boxes, or you can choose
     single or even multiple items from the drop-down list.

   * Read-only items are marked as gray.

   * Hover the mouse cursor over the item to see the description.

#. Add or remove User VM (UOS) launch scripts:

   * Click **Configure an UOS below** to add a User VM launch script.

   * Click **Remove this VM** to remove a User VM launch script.

   .. image:: images/configure_launch_add.png
      :align: center

#. Click **Export XML** to save the launch configuration file. A dialog box
   appears, enabling you to save the file to a specific folder by inputting the
   absolute path to this folder. If you don't specify a path, the file will
   be saved to the default folder:
   ``acrn-hypervisor/../user_config/<board name>``.

   Before saving the launch configuration file, the configurator validates the
   configurable items. If errors exist, the configurator lists all incorrectly
   configured items and shows the errors.

#. To delete a launch configuration file, click **Export XML** > **Remove**.
   The configurator will delete the loaded file, even if you change the name of
   the file in the dialog box.

#. Click **Generate Launch Script** to save the current launch configuration
   and then generate a launch script for each VM defined in the launch
   configuration.

   .. image:: images/generate_launch_script.png
      :align: center

#. Confirm that the launch scripts appear in the
   ``<board name>/output`` directory.

#. When you are done using the tool, close the browser and press
   :kbd:`CTRL` + :kbd:`C` to terminate the
   ``acrn_configurator.py`` program running in the terminal window.
