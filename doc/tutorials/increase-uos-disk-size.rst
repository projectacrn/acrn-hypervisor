.. _Increase User VM disk size:

Increase the User VM Disk Size
##############################

This document builds on :ref:`getting_started` and assumes you already have
a system with ACRN installed and running correctly. The size of the pre-built
Clear Linux User OS (User VM) virtual disk is typically only 8GB and this may not be
sufficient for some applications. This guide explains a simple few steps to
increase the size of that virtual disk.

This document is largely inspired from Clear Linux's `Increase virtual disk size
of a Clear Linux* OS image
<https://docs.01.org/clearlinux/latest/guides/maintenance/increase-virtual-disk-size.html>`_
tutorial. The process can be
broken down into three steps:

1. Increase the virtual disk (``uos.img``) size
#. Resize the ``rootfs`` partition
#. Resize the filesystem

.. note::

   These steps are performed directly on the User VM disk image. The User VM **must**
   be powered off during this operation.

Increase the virtual disk size
******************************

We will use the ``qemu-img`` tool to increase the size of the virtual disk
(``uos.img``) file. On a Clear Linux system, you can install this tool using:

.. code-block:: none

   $ sudo swupd bundle-add clr-installer

As an example, let us add 10GB of storage to our virtual disk image called
``uos.img``.

.. code-block:: none

   $ qemu-img resize -f raw uos.img +10G

.. note::

   Replace ``uos.img`` by the actual name of your virtual disk file if you
   deviated from the :ref:`getting_started`.

.. note::

   You can choose any increment for the additional storage space. Check the
   ``qemu-img resize`` help for more information.

Resize the ``rootfs`` partition
*******************************

The next step is to modify the ``rootfs`` partition (in Clear Linux, it is
partition 3) to use the additional space available. We will use the ``parted``
tool and perform these steps:

* Enter the ``parted`` tool
* Press ``p`` to print the partition tables
* A warning will be displayed, enter ``Fix``
* Enter ``resizepart 3``
* Enter the size of the disk (``19.9GB`` in our example)
* Enter ``q`` to quit the tool

Here is what the sequence looks like:

.. code-block:: none

   $ parted uos.img

.. code-block:: console
   :emphasize-lines: 5,7,9,19,20

Resize the filesystem
*********************

The final step is to resize the ``rootfs`` filesystem to use the entire
partition space.

.. code-block:: none

   $ LOOP_DEV=`sudo losetup -f -P --show uos.img`
   $ PART_DEV=$LOOP_DEV
   $ PART_DEV+="p3"
   $ sudo e2fsck -f $PART_DEV
   $ sudo resize2fs -p $PART_DEV
   $ sudo losetup -d $LOOP_DEV

Congratulations! You have successfully resized the disk, partition, and
filesystem of your User VM.
