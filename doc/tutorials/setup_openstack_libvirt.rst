Configure ACRN using OpenStack and libvirt
##########################################

Introduction
************

This document provides instructions for setting up libvirt to configure
ACRN. We use OpenStack to use libvirt and we'll install OpenStack in a container
to avoid crashing your system and to take advantage of easy
snapshots/restores so that you can quickly roll back your system in the
event of setup failure. (You should only install OpenStack directly on Ubuntu if
you have a dedicated testing machine.) This setup utilizes LXC/LXD on
Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04.

Install ACRN
************

#. Install ACRN using Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 as its Service VM. Refer to
   :ref:`Ubuntu Service OS`.

#. Make the acrn-kernel using the `kernel_config_uefi_sos
   <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectacrn/acrn-kernel/master/kernel_config_uefi_sos>`_
   configuration file (from the ``acrn-kernel`` repo).

#. Add the following kernel bootarg to give the Service VM  more loop
   devices. Refer to `Kernel Boot Parameters
   <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBootParameters>`_ documentation::

      max_loop=16

#. Boot the Service VM with this new ``acrn-kernel`` using the ACRN
   hypervisor.
#. Use the command: ``losetup -a`` to verify that Ubuntu's snap service is **not**
   using all available loop devices. Typically, OpenStack needs at least 4
   available loop devices. Follow the `snaps guide
   <https://maslosoft.com/kb/how-to-clean-old-snaps/>`_ to clean up old
   snap revisions if you're running out of loop devices.
#. Make sure the networking bridge ``acrn-br0`` is created. If not,
   create it using the instructions in
   :ref:`Enable network sharing <enable-network-sharing-user-vm>`.

Set up and launch LXC/LXD
*************************

1. Set up the LXC/LXD Linux container engine using these `instructions
   <https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-setting-up-lxd-1604>`_ provided
   by Ubuntu (for release 16.04).

   Refer to the following additional information for the setup
   procedure:

   - Disregard ZFS utils (we're not going to use the ZFS storage
     backend).
   - Answer ``dir`` (and not ``zfs``) when prompted for the name of the storage backend to use.
   - Set up ``lxdbr0`` as instructed.
   - Before launching a container, make sure ``lxc-checkconfig | grep missing`` does not show any missing
     kernel features.

2. Create an Ubuntu 18.04 container named **openstack**::

     $ lxc init ubuntu:18.04 openstack

3. Export the kernel interfaces necessary to launch a Service VM in the
   **openstack** container:

   a. Edit the **openstack** config file using the command::

        $ lxc config edit openstack

      In the editor, add the following lines under **config**:

      .. code-block:: none

         linux.kernel_modules: iptable_nat, ip6table_nat, ebtables, openvswitch
         raw.lxc: |-
           lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 10:237 rwm
           lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = b 7:* rwm
           lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 243:0 rwm
           lxc.mount.entry = /dev/net/tun dev/net/tun none bind,create=file 0 0
           lxc.mount.auto=proc:rw sys:rw cgroup:rw
         security.nesting: "true"
         security.privileged: "true"

      Save and exit the editor.

   b. Run the following commands to configure OpenStack::

         $ lxc config device add openstack eth1 nic name=eth1 nictype=bridged parent=acrn-br0
         $ lxc config device add openstack acrn_vhm unix-char path=/dev/acrn_vhm
         $ lxc config device add openstack loop-control unix-char path=/dev/loop-control
         $ for n in {0..15}; do lxc config device add openstack loop$n unix-block path=/dev/loop$n; done;

4. Launch the **openstack** container::

     $ lxc start openstack

5. Log in to the **openstack** container::

     $ lxc exec openstack -- su -l

6. Let ``systemd`` manage **eth1** in the container, with **eth0** as the
   default route:

   Edit ``/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml``

   .. code-block:: none

      network:
          version: 2
          ethernets:
              eth0:
                  dhcp4: true
              eth1:
                  dhcp4: true
                  dhcp4-overrides:
                      route-metric: 200


7. Log out and restart the **openstack** container::

     $ lxc restart openstack

8. Log in to the **openstack** container again::

     $ xc exec openstack -- su -l

9. If needed, set up the proxy inside the **openstack** container via
   ``/etc/environment`` and make sure ``no_proxy`` is properly set up.
   Both IP addresses assigned to **eth0** and
   **eth1** and their subnets must be included. For example::

     no_proxy=xcompany.com,.xcompany.com,10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16,localhost,.local,127.0.0.0/8,134.134.0.0/16

10. Add a new user named **stack** and set permissions::

       $ sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /opt/stack -m stack
       $ echo "stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers

11. Log out and restart the **openstack** container::

      $ lxc restart openstack

The **openstack** container is now properly configured for OpenStack.
Use the ``lxc list`` command to verify that both **eth0** and **eth1**
appear in the container.

Set up ACRN prerequisites inside the container
**********************************************

1. Log in to the **openstack** container as the **stack** user::

     $ lxc exec openstack -- su -l stack

2. Download and compile ACRN's source code. Refer to :ref:`getting-started-building`.

   .. note::
      All tools and build dependencies must be installed before you run the first ``make`` command.

   .. code-block:: none

      $ git clone https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor
      $ cd acrn-hypervisor
      $ git checkout v1.6.1
      $ make
      $ cd misc/acrn-manager/; make

   Install only the user-space components: acrn-dm, acrnctl, and acrnd

3. Download, compile, and install ``iasl``. Refer to :ref:`Prepare the User VM <prepare-UOS>`.

Set up libvirt
**************

1. Install the required packages::

     $ sudo apt install libdevmapper-dev libnl-route-3-dev libnl-3-dev python \
       automake autoconf autopoint libtool xsltproc libxml2-utils gettext

2. Download libvirt/ACRN::

     $ git clone https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-libvirt.git

3. Build and install libvirt::

     $ cd acrn-libvirt
     $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --disable-werror --with-test-suite=no \
       --with-qemu=no --with-openvz=no --with-vmware=no --with-phyp=no \
       --with-vbox=no --with-lxc=no --with-uml=no --with-esx=no

     $ make
     $ sudo make install

4. Edit and enable these options in ``/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf``::

     unix_sock_ro_perms = "0777"
     unix_sock_rw_perms = "0777"
     unix_sock_admin_perms = "0777"

5. Restart the libvirt daemon::

     $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload


Set up OpenStack
****************

Use DevStack to install OpenStack. Refer to the `DevStack instructions <https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/>`_.

1. Use the latest maintenance branch **stable/train** to ensure OpenStack
   stability::

     $ git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack.git -b stable/train

2. Go to the devstack directory (``cd devstack``) and apply the following
   patch:

   ``0001-devstack-installation-for-acrn.patch``

3. Edit ``lib/nova_plugins/hypervisor-libvirt``:

   Change ``xen_hvmloader_path`` to the location of your OVMF image
   file. A stock image is included in the ACRN source tree
   (``devicemodel/bios/OVMF.fd``).

4. Create a ``devstack/local.conf`` file as shown below (setting the password as
   appropriate):

   .. code-block:: none


      [[local|localrc]]
      PUBLIC_INTERFACE=eth1

      ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password>
      DATABASE_PASSWORD=<password>
      RABBIT_PASSWORD=<password>
      SERVICE_PASSWORD=<password>

      ENABLE_KSM=False
      VIRT_DRIVER=libvirt
      LIBVIRT_TYPE=acrn
      DEBUG_LIBVIRT=True
      DEBUG_LIBVIRT_COREDUMPS=True
      USE_PYTHON3=True

   .. note::
      Now is a great time to take a snapshot of the container using ``lxc
      snapshot``. If the OpenStack installation fails, manually rolling back
      to the previous state can be difficult. Currently, no step exists to
      reliably restart OpenStack after restarting the container.

5. Install OpenStack::

     execute ./stack.sh in devstack/

   The installation should take about 20-30 minutes. Upon successful
   installation, the installer reports the URL of OpenStack's management
   interface. This URL is accessible from the native Ubuntu.

   .. code-block:: console

      ...

      Horizon is now available at http://<IP_address>/dashboard

      ...

      2020-04-09 01:21:37.504 | stack.sh completed in 1755 seconds.

6. Verify using the command ``systemctl status libvirtd.service`` that libvirtd is active
   and running.

7. Set up SNAT for OpenStack instances to connect to the external network.

   a. Inside the container, use the command ``ip a`` to identify the ``br-ex`` bridge
      interface. ``br-ex`` should have two IPs. One should be visible to
      the native Ubuntu's ``acrn-br0`` interface (e.g. inet 192.168.1.104/24).
      The other one is internal to OpenStack (e.g. inet 172.24.4.1/24). The
      latter corresponds to the public network in OpenStack.

   b. Set up SNAT to establish a link between ``acrn-br0`` and OpenStack.
      For example::

        $ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 172.24.4.1/24 -o br-ex -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.1.104

Final Steps
***********

1. Create OpenStack instances.

   - OpenStack logs to systemd journal
   - libvirt logs to /var/log/libvirt/libvirtd.log

   You can now use the URL to manage OpenStack in your native Ubuntu
   as admin and using the password set in the local.conf file when you
   set up OpenStack earlier.

2. Create a router between **public** (external network) and **shared**
   (internal network) using `OpenStack's network instructions
   <https://docs.openstack.org/openstackdocstheme/latest/demo/create_and_manage_networks.html>`_.


3. Launch an ACRN instance using `OpenStack's launch instructions
   <https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/user/launch-instances.html>`_.

   - Use Clear Linux Cloud Guest as the image (qcow2 format):
     https://clearlinux.org/downloads
   - Skip **Create Key Pair** as it's not supported by Clear Linux.
   - Select **No** for **Create New Volume** when selecting the instance
     boot source image.
   - Use **shared** as the instance's network.

4. After the instance is created, use the hypervisor console to verify that
   it is running (``vm_list``).

5. Ping the instance inside the container using the instance's floating IP
   address.

6. Clear Linux prohibits root SSH login by default. Use libvirt's ``virsh``
   console to configure the instance. Inside the container, run::

     $ sudo virsh -c acrn:///system
     list   #you should see the instance listed as running
     console <instance_name>

7. Log in to the Clear Linux instance and set up the root SSH. Refer to
   the Clear Linux instructions on `enabling root login
   <https://docs.01.org/clearlinux/latest/guides/network/openssh-server.html#enable-root-login>`_.

   a. If needed, set up the proxy inside the instance.
   b. Configure ``systemd-resolved`` to use the correct DNS server.
   c. Install ping: ``swupd bundle-add clr-network-troubleshooter``.

   The ACRN instance should now be able to ping ``acrn-br0`` and another
   ACRN instance. It should also be accessible inside the container via SSH
   and its floating IP address.

   The ACRN instance can be deleted via the OpenStack management interface.

For more advanced CLI usage, refer to this `OpenStack cheat sheet
<https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/user-guide/cli-cheat-sheet.html>`_.
