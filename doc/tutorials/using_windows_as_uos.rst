ACRN Service VM Setup
*********************
If necessary, refer to the steps in :ref:`kbl-nuc-sdc` to set up ACRN on the
KBL NUC. Once complete, you should be able to launch the Service VM
successfully.

Setup for Using Windows as the Guest VM
***************************************
All patches to support WaaG have been upstreamed; download them from the
``acrn-hypervisor repository``.

Build ACRN EFI Images
=====================
#. Follow the steps described at :ref:`getting-started-building` to set up the build environment.
#. Use the ``make`` command to compile the ``acrn.efi`` and ``acrn-dm``::

   $ git clone https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor.git
   $ cd acrn-hypervisor
   $ make FIRMWARE=uefi BOARD=kbl-nuc-i7

#. Get the outputs from the following::

   $ build/hypervisor/acrn.efi
   $ build/devicemodel/acrn-dm

#. Replace the ``acrn.efi`` and ``acrn-dm`` on your NUC:

   a. Log in to the ACRN Service VM and then ``mount`` the EFI partition to ``/boot``
   #. ``scp`` the ``acrn.efi`` and ``acrn-dm`` from your host::

      # scp <acrn.efi from your host> /boot/EFI/acrn/
      # scp <acrn-dm from your host> /usr/bin/
      # chmod +x /usr/bin/acrn-dm && sync

Build the Service VM Kernel
===========================
#. Follow the steps described at :ref:`getting-started-building` to set up
   the build environment.
#. Follow the steps below to build the ACRN kernel::

   $ WORKDIR=`pwd`;
   $ JOBS=`nproc`
   $ git clone -b master https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-kernel.git
   $ cd acrn-kernel && mkdir -p ${WORKDIR}/{build,build-rootfs}
   $ cp kernel_config_uefi_sos ${WORKDIR}/build/.config
   $ make olddefconfig O=${WORKDIR}/build && make -j${JOBS} O=${WORKDIR}/build
   $ make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=${WORKDIR}/build-rootfs O=${WORKDIR}/build -j${JOBS}

Update the Kernel on KBL NUC
============================
#. Copy the new kernel image (bzImage) and its modules to the target machine::

   # scp <your host>:$WORKDIR/build/arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/bzImage
   # scp -r <your host>:$WORKDIR/build-rootfs/lib/modules/* /lib/modules/
   # cp /boot/loader/entries/acrn.conf  /boot/loader/entries/acrngt.conf

#. Modify ``acrngt.conf`` to the content as shown below:

   .. code-block:: none

      title The ACRNGT Service VM
      linux /bzImage
      options console=tty0 console=ttyS0 root=/dev/sda3 rw rootwait ignore_loglevel no_timer_check consoleblank=0 i915.nuclear_pageflip=1 i915.avail_planes_per_pipe=0x010101 i915.domain_plane_owners=0x011100001111 i915.enable_gvt=1 i915.enable_conformance_check=0 i915.enable_guc=0 hvlog=2M@0x1FE00000

   .. note:: Change ``/dev/sda3`` to your file system partition.

#. ``reboot`` the Service VM and select ``The ACRNGT Service VM`` from the
   boot menu to apply the ACRN kernel and hypervisor updates.

Create Windows 10 Image in Service VM
=====================================
Create a Windows 10 image to install Windows 10 onto a virtual disk.

Download Win10 ISO and Drivers
------------------------------
#. Download `Windows 10 LTSC ISO <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise>`_.

   - Select **ISO-LTSC**, then click **Continue**.
   - Complete the required info then click **Continue**.
   - Select the language and **x86 64 bit**, then click **Download ISO** and save as ``windows10-LTSC-17763.iso``.

#. Download the `Intel DCH Graphics Driver <https://downloadmirror.intel.com/29074/a08/igfx_win10_100.7212.zip>`_.

#. Download the `Oracle Windows driver <https://edelivery.oracle.com/osdc/faces/SoftwareDelivery>`_.

   - Sign in. If you do not have an Oracle account, register for one.
   - Select **Download Package**. Key in **Oracle Linux 7.6** and click **Search**.
   - Click **DLP: Oracle Linux 7.6**; it will be added to your Cart.
   - Click **Checkout** which is located at the top right corner.
   - Under **Platforms/Language**, select **x86 64 bit**, and click **Continue**.
   - Check **I accept the terms in the license agreement**; click **Continue**.
   - In the list, right check the item labeled **Oracle VirtIO Drivers Version for Microsoft Windows 1.x.x, yy MB**,
     and then **Save link as ...**.  Currently, it is named **V982789-01.zip**.
   - Click **Download**. When the download is complete, unzip the file. You will see an ISO named **winvirtio.iso**.

Create Raw Disk
---------------
Run these commands on the Service VM::

   # swupd bundle-add kvm-host
   # mkdir /root/img
   # cd /root/img
   # qemu-img create -f raw win10-ltsc.img 30G

Prepare Script to Create Image
-------------------------------

#. Copy ``/usr/share/acrn/samples/nuc/launch_win.sh`` to ``install_win.sh``::

   # cp /usr/share/acrn/samples/nuc/launch_win.sh ~/install_win.sh


#. Edit the ``acrn-dm`` command line in ``install_win.sh`` as follows:

   .. note:: Make sure you use GVT-g ``-s 2,pci-gvt -G "$2"`` in acrn-dm
      command line. Now we cannot support creating windows image by GVT-d.

   - Change ``-s 3,virtio-blk,./win10-ltsc.img`` to your path to the Windows 10 image.

   - Add ``-s 6,xhci,1-5:1-9``. You may need to change 1-5:1-9 to match the ports of
     the USB keyboard/Mouse and flash on your platform.

   - Add ``-s 8,ahci,cd:./windows10-LTSC-17763.iso`` to point to the Win10 ISO.

   - Add ``-s 9,ahci,cd:./winvirtio.iso`` to point to your path to the winvirtio iso.

Install Windows 10 by GVT-g
---------------------------
.. note:: Make sure you have configured your monitor and display according to **3** of
      :ref:`Boot Windows with GVT-g on ACRN <waag_display_conf_lable>`.

#. Run ``install_win.sh``. When you see the UEFI shell, input **exit**.

#. Select **Boot Manager** and boot up from Win10 ISO.

#. When the display reads **Press any key to boot from CD or DVD** on the monitor,
   press any key in the terminal on the **Host** side.

#. Copy `Intel DCH Graphics Driver <https://downloadmirror.intel.com/29074/a08/igfx_win10_100.7212.zip>`_ into
   Windows and install; the display driver is updated to 7212.

Boot Windows on ACRN with default configuration
===============================================
#. Modify the ``/usr/share/acrn/samples/nuc/launch_win.sh`` script to specify the Windows image generated above.

#. Run the ``launch_win.sh``. The WaaG desktop displays on the HDMI monitor.

   .. note:: We support GVT-g and GVT-d while launching Windows guest.
         If you use GVT-g, you can set up Weston in the Service VM, and follow
         the steps in :ref:`skl-nuc-gpu-passthrough` to set up Weston as the
         desktop environment in the Service VM to experience Windows with the
         AcrnGT local display feature. If you use GVT-d, then only Windows has
         display.

Explanation for acrn-dm popular command lines
*********************************************

.. note:: You can use these acrn-dm command lines according to your real requirements.

* *-s 2,passthru,0/2/0,gpu*:
  This is GVT-d, to passthrough VGA controller to Windows.
  You may need to change 0/2/0 to match the bdf of the VGA controller on your platform.

* *-s 3,ahci,hd:/root/img/win10.img*:
  This is the hard disk onto which to install Windows 10.
  Make sure that the slot ID 3 points to your win10 img path.

* *-s 4,virtio-net,tap0*:
  This is for the network virtualization.

* *-s 5,fbuf,tcp=0.0.0.0:5900,w=800,h=600*:
  This opens a port 5900 on the Service VM which can be connected to via vncviewer.

* *-s 6,virtio-input,/dev/input/event4*:
  This is to passthrough the mouse/keyboard to Windows via virtio.
  Change ``event4`` accordingly. Use the following command to check
  the event node on your Service VM::

   <To get the input event of mouse>
   # cat /proc/bus/input/devices | grep mouse

* *-s 7,ahci,cd:/root/img/Windows10.iso*:
  This is the IOS image used to install Windows 10. It appears as a cdrom
  device. Make sure that the slot ID 7 points to your win10 ISO path.

* *-s 8,ahci,cd:/root/img/winvirtio.iso*:
  This is cdrom device to install the virtio Windows driver. Make sure it points to your VirtIO ISO path.

* *-s 9,passthru,0/14/0*:
  This is to passthrough USB controller to Windows.
  You may need to change 0/14/0 to match the bdf of the USB controller on your platform.

* *--ovmf /usr/share/acrn/bios/OVMF.fd*:
  Make sure it points to your OVMF binary path.

Secure boot enabling
********************
Refer to the steps in :ref:`How-to-enable-secure-boot-for-windows` for
secure boot enabling.

Activate Windows 10
********************
If you are using a trial version of Windows 10, you might find that some
apps and features do not work or that Windows 10 automatically gets shut
down by the Windows licensing monitoring service. To avoid these issues,
obtain a licensed version of Windows.

For Windows 10 activation steps, refer to
"`Activate Windows 10 <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12440/windows-10-activate>`__"
