ACRN Service VM Setup
*********************
You may refer to the steps in :ref:`getting-started-apl-nuc` for
Intel NUC to set up ACRN on the KBL NUC. After following the steps in that guide,
you should be able to launch the Service VM successfully.

Setup for Using Windows as Guest VM
***********************************
All the patches to support WaaG have been upstreamed; you can download them
from the acrn-hypervisor repository.

Build ACRN EFI Images
=====================
#. Follow the steps described at :ref:`getting-started-building` to set up the build environment.
#. Use the ``make`` command to compile the ``acrn.efi`` and ``acrn-dm``::

   $ git clone https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor.git
   $ cd acrn-hypervisor
   $ make FIRMWARE=uefi BOARD=kbl-nuc-i7

#. Get the outputs from::

   $ build/hypervisor/acrn.efi
   $ build/devicemodel/acrn-dm

#. Replace the ``acrn.efi`` and ``acrn-dm`` on your NUC:

   a. Log in to the ACRN Service VM and then ``mount`` the EFI partition to ``/boot``
   #. ``scp`` the ``acrn.efi`` and ``acrn-dm`` from your host::

      # scp <acrn.efi from your host> /boot/EFI/acrn/
      # scp <acrn-dm from your host> /usr/bin/
      # chmod +x /usr/bin/acrn-dm && sync

Build Service VM Kernel
=======================
#. Follow the steps described at :ref:`getting-started-building` to set up the build environment.
#. Follow the steps below to build the ACRN kernel::

   $ WORKDIR=`pwd`;
   $ JOBS=`nproc`
   $ git clone -b masterÂ https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-kernel.git
   $ cd acrn-kernel && mkdir -p ${WORKDIR}/{build,build-rootfs}
   $ cp kernel_config_uefi_sos ${WORKDIR}/build/.config
   $ make olddefconfig O=${WORKDIR}/build && make -j${JOBS} O=${WORKDIR}/build
   $ make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=${WORKDIR}/build-rootfs O=${WORKDIR}/build -j${JOBS}

Update Kernel on KBL NUC
========================
#. Copy the new kernel image (bzImage) and its modules to the target machine::

   # scp <your host>:$WORKDIR/build/arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/bzImage
   # scp -r <your host>:$WORKDIR/build-rootfs/lib/modules/* /lib/modules/
   # cp /boot/loader/entries/acrn.conf  /boot/loader/entries/acrngt.conf

#. Modify ``acrngt.conf`` to the content as given below:

   .. code-block:: none

      title The ACRNGT Service VM
      linux /bzImage
      options console=tty0 console=ttyS0 root=/dev/sda3 rw rootwait ignore_loglevel no_timer_check consoleblank=0 i915.nuclear_pageflip=1 i915.avail_planes_per_pipe=0x010101 i915.domain_plane_owners=0x011100001111 i915.enable_gvt=1 i915.enable_conformance_check=0 i915.enable_guc=0 hvlog=2M@0x1FE00000

   .. note:: Change ``/dev/sda3`` to your file system partition.

#. ``reboot`` the Service VM and select ``The ACRNGT Service VM`` from the boot menu to apply
   the ACRN kernel and hypervisor updates.

Create Windows 10 Image
=======================
Create a Windows 10 image which includes two steps:

#. Re-generate an ISO that includes winvirtio or virtio-win drivers and the Windows graphics drivers that were pre-installed
   from the original Windows ISO.

#. Install Windows 10 onto the virtual disk.

Preparations
------------
* Download `Windows 10 ADK <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/get-started/adk-install>`_
  according to your working Windows 10 version.

.. note:: :kbd:`Win` + :kbd:`R` to open the Run window. Key in ``winver`` to get your working Windows version.

* Download `Windows 10 LTSC ISO
  <https://software-download.microsoft.com/download/sg/17763.107.101029-1455.rs5_release_svc_refresh_CLIENT_LTSC_EVAL_x64FRE_en-us.iso>`_.

* Download `virtio Windows driver
  <https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/archive-virtio/virtio-win-0.1.141-1/virtio-win-0.1.141.iso>`_
  to the Service VM in ``/root/img/virtio-win-0.1.141.iso``.

* Download `Intel DCH Graphics Driver <https://downloadmirror.intel.com/28148/a08/dch_win64_25.20.100.6444.exe>`_.

* Download Oracle Windows driver to Service VM in ``/root/img/winvirtio.iso``.
*  `Oracle Windows driver <https://edelivery.oracle.com/osdc/faces/SoftwareDelivery>`_.Sign in. If you do not have an oracle account, register one.
*  Select "Download Package", key in "Oracle Linux 7.6" and click "Search"
*  Click: DLP: Oracle Linux 7.6, it will be added to your Cart.
*  Click "Checkout" at the top right corner
*  In the "Platforms/Language", select "x86 64 bit", click "Continue"
*  Check " I accept the terms in the license agreement", click "Continue"
*  In the list, right check the item labeled as "Oracle VirtIO Drivers Version for Microsoft Windows 1.x.x, yy MB", and "Save link as ...".  At the time of this wiki, it is named as "V982789-01.zip"
*  Click Download, When the download is complete, unzip, you will get one ISO named "winvirtio.iso"

Install Windows 10 ADK
----------------------
#. Double click ``adksetup.exe`` to start the installation.

   .. figure:: images/adk_install_1.png
      :align: center

#. Click ``Next``.

   .. figure:: images/adk_install_2.png
      :align: center

#. Select ``Deployment Tools`` and ``Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE)``,
   and click ``Install`` to continue the installation.

   .. note:: You need to install Windows 10 ADK only once.

Pre-install drivers and re-generate Windows ISO
-----------------------------------------------
#. Create a folder on the ``C:`` drive called ``WIM``, so you have a folder ``C:\WIM``

#. Create a folder on the ``C:`` drive called ``Mount``, so you have a folder ``C:\Mount``

#. Right click the downloaded ``virtio-win-0.1.141.iso`` and select ``Mount``. The ISO will be mounted to a drive;
   for example, drive ``D:``
   Or used Oracle Driver
   Right click the downloaded ``winvirtio.iso`` and select ``Mount``. The ISO will be mounted to a drive;
   for example, drive ``D:``

#. Use ``7-zip`` or similar utility to unzip the downloaded Windows graphics driver
   ``dch_win64_25.20.100.6444.exe`` to a folder,
   for example, to ``C:\Dev\Temp\wim\dch_win64_25.20.100.6444``

#. Right click the downloaded Windows ISO, for example, ``windows10-17763-107-LTSC.iso``, select ``Mount``,
   the ISO will be mounted to a drive; for example, drive ``E:``

#. Copy ``E:\sources\boot.wim`` and ``E:\sources\install.wim`` to ``C:\WIM``

#. Depending on your Windows ISO image, more than one image may be included in the ``WIM``.
   Run ``dism /get-wiminfo /wimfile:C:\WIM\install.wim`` with administrator privileges.
   Select the ``Index`` you want. For ``windows10-17763-107-LTSC.iso``,
   there is only one ``Index``; it is ``1``

   .. figure:: images/install_wim_index.png
      :align: center

#. Create a batch file named ``virtio-inject-boot.bat`` [1]_ to modify
   ``boot.wim`` to inject drivers (using the mounted Windows ISO drive
   (``D:``), image Index (``1``), and folder where the unzipped Windows
   graphics drivers were placed, from the previous steps (update this
   batch file as needed)::

   Run this script in a command prompt running as administrator.  It may also
   take 4-5 minutes to run, depending on your Windows system performance.


#. After running these two scripts the files ``C:\WIM\boot.wim`` and ``C:\WIM\install.wim``
   will be updated to install these drivers into the image:

   - Virtio-balloon
   - Virtio-net
   - Virtio-rng
   - Virtio-scsi
   - Virtio-serial
   - Virtio-block
   - Virtio-input
   - Windows graphics drivers

#. Use 7-zip to unzip the downloaded Windows ISO to a folder; for example, into
   ``C:\Dev\Temp\wim\windows10-17763-107-LTSC``

#. Delete ``C:\Dev\Temp\wim\windows10-17763-107-LTSC\sources\boot.wim`` and
   ``C:\Dev\Temp\wim\windows10-17763-107-LTSC\sources\install.wim``

#. Copy ``C:\WIM\boot.wim`` and ``C:\WIM\install.wim`` to ``C:\Dev\Temp\wim\windows10-17763-107-LTSC\sources``

#. Download and unzip `cdrtools-3.01.a23-bootcd.ru-mkisofs.7z
   <http://reboot.pro/index.php?app=core&module=attach&section=attach&attach_id=15214>`_ to a folder;
   for example, to ``C:\Dev\Temp\wim\cdrtools-3.01.a23-bootcd.ru-mkisofs``

#. Create a batch file named ``mkisofs_both_legacy_and_uefi.bat``
   containing (update folder names as needed to reflect where the
   referenced files are located on your system, and ``inputdir``,
   ``outputiso`` and ``mkisofs.exe`` path, downloaded by the previous
   step)::

      set inputdir=C:\Dev\Temp\wim\windows10-17763-107-LTSC
      set outputiso=C:\Dev\Temp\wim\mkisofs_iso\windows10-17763-107-LTSC-Virtio-Gfx.iso
      set label="WIN10_17763_107_LTSC_VIRTIO_GFX"
      set biosboot=boot/etfsboot.com
      set efiboot=efi/microsoft/boot/efisys.bin
      C:\Dev\Temp\wim\cdrtools-3.01.a23-bootcd.ru-mkisofs\mingw\mkisofs.exe \
        -iso-level 4 -l -R -UDF -D -volid %label% -b %biosboot% -no-emul-boot \
        -boot-load-size 8 -hide boot.catalog -eltorito-alt-boot \
        -eltorito-platform efi -no-emul-boot -b %efiboot%  -o %outputiso% \
        %inputdir%

   Run this ``mkisofs_both_legacy_and_uefi.bat`` script. The resulting
   ISO will be generated in ``outputiso`` location you specified.

Create Raw Disk
---------------
Run these commands on the Service VM::

   # swupd bundle-add kvm-host
   # mkdir /root/img
   # cd /root/img
   # qemu-img create -f raw win10-ltsc-virtio.img 30G

Install Windows 10
------------------
Currently, the ACRNGT OVMF GOP driver is not ready; thus, a special VGA
version is used to install Windows 10 on ACRN from scratch. The
``acrn.efi``, ``acrn-dm`` and ``OVMF`` binaries are included in the
`tarball
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor/master/doc/tutorials/install_by_vga_gsg.tar.gz>`_
together with the script used to install Windows 10.

#. Uncompress ``install_by_vga_gsg.tar.gz`` to the Service VM::

   # tar zxvf install_by_vga_gsg.tar.gz && cd install_by_vga_gsg

#. Edit the ``acrn-dm`` command line in ``install_vga.sh`` if your configuration is different.

   - Change ``-s 3,virtio-blk,./win10-ltsc-virtio.img`` to your path to the Windows 10 image.
   - Change ``-s 8,ahci,cd:./windows10-17763-107-LTSC-Virtio-Gfx.iso`` to the ISO you re-generated above.
   - Change ``-s 9,ahci,cd:./virtio-win-0.1.141.iso`` to your path to the virtio-win iso.

   Or if you used the Oracle driver:

   - Change ``-s 9,ahci,cd:./winvirtio.iso`` to your path to the winvirtio iso.

#. Run ``install_vga.sh`` and connect to the Windows guest using a vnc client.::

   # vncviewer <IP-OF-HOST-MACHINE>:5900

#. Input ``exit`` followed by :kbd:`ENTER`

   .. figure:: images/windows_install_1.png
      :align: center

#. Select ``Boot Manager``

   .. figure:: images/windows_install_2.png
      :align: center

#. Select ``UEFI ACRN-DM SATA DVD ROM ACRN--F9B7-5503-A05B``, which is using the PCI slot 7.
   This is what we configured in the script for the Windows ISO cdrom.

   .. figure:: images/windows_install_3.png
      :align: center

#. Select :kbd:`ENTER` followed by any key press to be prompted to the Windows installation screen.

   .. figure:: images/windows_install_7.png
      :align: center

   .. figure:: images/windows_install_8.png
      :align: center

#. Connect again after Windows guest reboots. Use ``vncviewer <IP-OF-HOST-MACHINE>:5900``.

   .. figure:: images/windows_install_9.png
      :align: center

#. Connect again after Windows guest reboots a second time. Use ``vncviewer <IP-OF-HOST-MACHINE>:5900``.

   .. figure:: images/windows_install_10.png
      :align: center

#. Perform a few configuration steps. The Windows desktop appears.

Boot Windows with GVT-g on ACRN
===============================
#. Modify the ``/usr/share/acrn/samples/nuc/launch_win.sh`` script to specify the Windows image generated above.

#. Run the ``launch_win.sh`` and you should see the WaaG desktop coming up over the HDMI monitor (instead of the VNC).

   .. note:: Use the following command to disable the GNOME Display Manager (GDM) if it is enabled::

      # sudo systemctl mask gdm.service

   .. note:: You must connect two monitors to the KBL NUC in order to launch Windows with
      the default configurations above.

   .. note:: The second monitor must include the Weston desktop. If you have set up Weston in the Service VM,
      follow the steps in :ref:`skl-nuc-gpu-passthrough` to set up Weston as
      the desktop environment in Service VM in order to experience Windows with the AcrnGT local display feature.
