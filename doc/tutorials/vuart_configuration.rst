Enable vUART Configurations
###########################

Introduction
============

The virtual universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (vUART) supports
two functions: one is the console, the other is communication. vUART
only works on a single function.

Only two vUART configurations are added to the predefined scenarios,
but you can customize the scenarios to enable more using the :ref:`ACRN
configuration toolset <acrn_config_workflow>`.

.. _how-to-configure-a-console-port:

How to Configure a Console Port
===============================

To enable the console port for a VM, change only the ``port_base`` and
``irq``. If the IRQ number is already in use in your system (``cat
/proc/interrupt``), choose another IRQ number. If you set the ``.irq =0``,
the vUART will work in polling mode.

- ``COM1_BASE (0x3F8) + COM1_IRQ(4)``
- ``COM2_BASE (0x2F8) + COM2_IRQ(3)``
- ``COM3_BASE (0x3E8) + COM3_IRQ(6)``
- ``COM4_BASE (0x2E8) + COM4_IRQ(7)``

Example:

.. code-block:: none

   .vuart[0] = {
                        .type = VUART_LEGACY_PIO,
                        .addr.port_base = COM1_BASE,
                        .irq = COM1_IRQ,
                },

.. _how-to-configure-a-communication-port:

How to Configure a Communication Port
=====================================

To enable the communication port, configure ``vuart[1]`` in the two VMs that want to communicate.

The port_base and IRQ should differ from the ``vuart[0]`` in the same VM.

``t_vuart.vm_id`` is the target VM's vm_id, start from 0. (0 means VM0)

``t_vuart.vuart_id`` is the target vUART index in the target VM. Start
from ``1``. (``1`` means ``vuart[1]``)

Example:

.. code-block:: none

   /* VM0 */
   ...
   /* VM1 */
   .vuart[1] = {
                        .type = VUART_LEGACY_PIO,
                        .addr.port_base = COM2_BASE,
                        .irq = COM2_IRQ,
                        .t_vuart.vm_id = 2U,
                        .t_vuart.vuart_id = 1U,
                },
   ...
   /* VM2 */
   .vuart[1] = {
                        .type = VUART_LEGACY_PIO,
                        .addr.port_base = COM2_BASE,
                        .irq = COM2_IRQ,
                        .t_vuart.vm_id = 1U,
                        .t_vuart.vuart_id = 1U,
                },

Launch Script
=============

-  ``-s 1:0,lpc -l com1,stdio``
   This option is only needed for WaaG and VxWorks (and also when using
   OVMF). They depend on the ACPI table, and only ``acrn-dm`` can provide
   the ACPI table for UART.

-  ``-B " ....,console=ttyS0, ..."``
   Add this to the kernel-based system.

Test the Communication Port
===========================

After you have configured the communication port in hypervisor, you can
access the corresponding port. For example, in Linux OS:

1. With ``echo`` and ``cat``

   On VM1: ``# cat /dev/ttyS1``

   On VM2: ``# echo "test test" > /dev/ttyS1``

   You can find the message from VM1 ``/dev/ttyS1``.

   If you are not sure which one is the communication port, you can run
   ``dmesg | grep ttyS`` under the Linux shell to check the base address.
   If it matches what you have set in the ``vm_configuration.c`` file, it
   is the correct port.


#. With Minicom

   Run ``minicom -D /dev/ttyS1`` on both VM1 and VM2 and enter ``test``
   in VM1's Minicom. The message should appear in VM2's Minicom. Disable
   flow control in Minicom.


#. Limitations

   -  The msg cannot be longer than 256 bytes.
   -  This cannot be used to transfer files because flow control is
       not supported so data may be lost.

vUART Design

**Communication vUART (between VM0 and VM1)**

   :align: center
   :name: communication-vuart

COM Port Configurations for Post-Launched VMs
=============================================

For a post-launched VM, the ``acrn-dm`` cmdline also provides a COM port configuration:

  ``-s 1:0,lpc -l com1,stdio``

This adds ``com1 (0x3f8)`` and ``com2 (0x2f8)`` modules in the Guest VM, including the ACPI info for these two ports.

**Data Flows**

Three different data flows exist based on how the post-launched VM is
started, as shown in the diagram below:

* Figure 1 data flow: The post-launched VM is started with the vUART
  enabled in the hypervisor configuration file only.
* Figure 2 data flow: The post-launched VM is started with the
  ``acrn-dm`` cmdline of ``-s 1:0,lpc -l com1,stdio`` only.
* Figure 3 data flow: The post-launched VM is started with both vUART
  enabled and the ``acrn-dm`` cmdline of ``-s 1:0,lpc -l com1,stdio``.

.. figure:: images/vuart-config-post-launch.png
   :align: center
   :name: Post-Launched VMs

.. note::
   For operating systems such as VxWorks and Windows that depend on the
   ACPI table to probe the UART driver, adding the vUART configuration in
   the hypervisor is not sufficient. We recommend that you use
   the configuration in the figure 3 data flow. This may be refined in the
   future.

Use PCI-vUART
#############

PCI Interface of ACRN vUART
===========================

When you set :ref:`vuart[0] and vuart[1] <vuart_config>`, the ACRN
hypervisor emulates virtual legacy serial devices (I/O port and IRQ) for
VMs. So ``vuart[0]`` and ``vuart[1]`` are legacy vUARTs.  ACRN
hypervisor can also emulate virtual PCI serial devices (BDF, MMIO
registers and MSIX capability). These virtual PCI serial devices are
called PCI-vUART, and have an advantage in device enumeration for the
guest OS.  It is easy to add new PCI-vUART ports to a VM.

.. _index-of-vuart:

Index of vUART
==============

ACRN hypervisor supports PCI-vUARTs and legacy vUARTs as ACRN vUARTs.
Each vUART port has its own ``vuart_idx``.  ACRN hypervisor supports up
to 8 vUART for each VM, from ``vuart_idx=0`` to ``vuart_idx=7``.
Suppose we use vUART0 for a port with ``vuart_idx=0``, vUART1 for
``vuart_idx=1``, and so on.

Pay attention to these points:

* vUART0 is the console port, vUART1-vUART7 are inter-VM communication ports.
* Each communication port must set the connection to another communication vUART port of another VM.
* When legacy ``vuart[0]`` is available, it is vUART0. A PCI-vUART can't
  be vUART0 unless ``vuart[0]`` is not set.
* When legacy ``vuart[1]`` is available, it is vUART1. PCI-vUART can't
  be vUART1 unless ``vuart[1]`` is not set.

Setup ACRN vUART Using Configuration Tools
==========================================

When you set up ACRN VM configurations with PCI-vUART, it is better to
use the ACRN configuration tools because of all the PCI resources required: BDF number,
address and size of mmio registers, and address and size of MSIX entry
tables. These settings can't conflict with another PCI device.  Furthermore,
whether PCI-vUART can use ``vuart_idx=0`` and ``vuart_idx=1`` depends on legacy
vUART settings.  Configuration tools will override your settings in
:ref:`How to Configure a Console Port <how-to-configure-a-console-port>`
and :ref:`How to Configure a Communication Port
<how-to-configure-a-communication-port>`.

You can configure both Legacy vUART and PCI-vUART in :ref:`scenario
configurations <acrn_config_types>`. For
example, if VM0 has a legacy vUART0 and a PCI-vUART1, VM1 has no legacy
vUART but has a PCI-vUART0 and a PCI-vUART1, VM0's PCI-vUART1 and VM1's
PCI-vUART1 are connected to each other. You  should configure then like this:

.. code-block:: none

   <vm id="0">
      <legacy_vuart id="0">
        <type>VUART_LEGACY_PIO</type>     /* vuart[0] is console port */
        <base>COM1_BASE</base>            /* vuart[0] is used */
        <irq>COM1_IRQ</irq>
      </legacy_vuart>
      <legacy_vuart id="1">
        <type>VUART_LEGACY_PIO</type>
        <base>INVALID_COM_BASE</base>     /* vuart[1] is not used */
      </legacy_vuart>
      <console_vuart id="0">
        <base>INVALID_PCI_BASE</base>     /* PCI-vUART0 can't be used, because vuart[0] */
      </console_vuart>
      <communication_vuart id="1">
        <base>PCI_VUART</base>            /* PCI-vUART1 is communication port, connect to vUART1 of VM1 */
        <target_vm_id>1</target_vm_id>
        <target_uart_id>1</target_uart_id>
      </communication_vuart>
   </vm>

   <vm id="1">
      <legacy_vuart id="0">
        <type>VUART_LEGACY_PIO</type>
        <base>INVALID_COM_BASE</base>     /* vuart[0] is not used */
      </legacy_vuart>
      <legacy_vuart id="1">
        <type>VUART_LEGACY_PIO</type>
        <base>INVALID_COM_BASE</base>     /* vuart[1] is not used */
      </legacy_vuart>
      <console_vuart id="0">
        <base>PCI_VUART</base>            /* PCI-vUART0 is console port */
      </console_vuart>
      <communication_vuart id="1">
        <base>PCI_VUART</base>            /* PCI-vUART1 is communication port, connect to vUART1 of VM0 */
        <target_vm_id>0</target_vm_id>
        <target_uart_id>1</target_uart_id>
      </communication_vuart>
   </vm>

The ACRN vUART related XML fields:

 - ``id`` in ``<legacy_vuart>``, value of ``vuart_idx``, ``id=0`` is for
   legacy ``vuart[0]`` configuration, ``id=1`` is for ``vuart[1]``.
 - ``type`` in ``<legacy_vuart>``, type is always ``VUART_LEGACY_PIO``
   for legacy vUART.
 - ``base`` in ``<legacy_vuart>``, if using the legacy vUART port, set
   COM1_BASE for ``vuart[0]``, set ``COM2_BASE`` for ``vuart[1]``.
   ``INVALID_COM_BASE`` means do not use the legacy vUART port.
 - ``irq`` in ``<legacy_vuart>``, if you use the legacy vUART port, set
   ``COM1_IRQ`` for ``vuart[0]``, set ``COM2_IRQ`` for ``vuart[1]``.
 - ``id`` in ``<console_vuart>`` and ``<communication_vuart>``,
   ``vuart_idx`` for PCI-vUART
 - ``base`` in ``<console_vuart>`` and ``<communication_vuart>``,
   ``PCI_VUART`` means use this PCI-vUART, ``INVALID_PCI_BASE`` means do
   not use this PCI-VUART.
 - ``target_vm_id`` and ``target_uart_id``, connection settings for this
   vUART port.

Run the command to build ACRN with this XML configuration file::

  make BOARD=<board> SCENARIO=<scenario>

The configuration tools will test your settings, and check :ref:`vUART
Rules <index-of-vuart>` for compilation issue. After compiling, you can find
the generated sources under
``build/hypervisor/configs/scenarios/<scenario>/pci_dev.c``,
based on the XML settings, something like:

.. code-block:: none

   struct acrn_vm_pci_dev_config vm0_pci_devs[] = {
       {
          .emu_type = PCI_DEV_TYPE_HVEMUL,
          .vbdf.bits = {.b = 0x00U, .d = 0x05U, .f = 0x00U},
          .vdev_ops = &vmcs9900_ops,
          .vbar_base[0] = 0x80003000,
          .vbar_base[1] = 0x80004000,
          .vuart_idx = 1,               /* PCI-vUART1 of VM0 */
          .t_vuart.vm_id = 1U,          /* connected to VM1's vUART1 */
          .t_vuart.vuart_id = 1U,
       },
    }

This struct shows a PCI-vUART with ``vuart_idx=1``, ``BDF 00:05.0``, it's
a PCI-vUART1 of
VM0, and it is connected to VM1's vUART1 port. When VM0 wants to communicate
with VM1, it can use ``/dev/ttyS*``, the character device file of
VM0's PCI-vUART1. Usually, legacy ``vuart[0]`` is ``ttyS0`` in VM, and
``vuart[1]`` is ``ttyS1``. So we hope PCI-vUART0 is ``ttyS0``,
PCI-VUART1 is ``ttyS1`` and so on through
PCI-vUART7 is ``ttyS7``, but that is not true. We can use BDF to identify
PCI-vUART in VM.

If you run ``dmesg | grep tty`` at a VM shell, you may see:

.. code-block:: none

   [    1.276891] 0000:00:05.0: ttyS4 at MMIO 0xa1414000 (irq = 124, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A

We know for VM0 guest OS, ``ttyS4`` has BDF 00:05.0 and is PCI-vUART1.
VM0 can communicate with VM1 by reading from or writing to ``/dev/ttyS4``.

If VM0 and VM1 are pre-launched VMs, or Service VM, ACRN hypervisor will
create PCI-vUART virtual devices automatically. For post-launched VMs,
created by ``acrn-dm``, an additional ``acrn-dm`` option is needed
to create a PCI-vUART virtual device:

.. code-block:: none

   -s <slot>,uart,vuart_idx:<val>

Kernel Config for Legacy vUART
==============================

When ACRN hypervisor passthroughs a local APIC to a VM, there is IRQ
injection issue for legacy vUART. The kernel driver must work in
polling mode to avoid the problem.  The VM kernel should have these config
symbols set:

.. code-block:: none

   CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_EXTENDED=y
   CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_DETECT_IRQ=y

Kernel Cmdline for PCI-vUART Console
====================================

When an ACRN VM does not have a legacy ``vuart[0]`` but has a
PCI-vUART0, you can use PCI-vUART0 for VM serial input/output.  Check
which TTY has the BDF of PCI-vUART0; usually it is not ``/dev/ttyS0``.
For example, if ``/dev/ttyS4`` is PCI-vUART0, you must set
``console=/dev/ttyS4`` in the kernel cmdline.
