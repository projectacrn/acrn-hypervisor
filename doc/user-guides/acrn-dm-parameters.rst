Device Model Parameters
#######################

Hypervisor Device Model (DM) is a QEMU-like application in the Service
VM responsible for creating a User VM and then performing devices
emulation based on command line configurations, as introduced in
:ref:`hld-devicemodel`.

Here are descriptions for each of these ``acrn-dm`` command line parameters:

``-A``, ``--acpi``
   Create ACPI tables.  With this option, DM will build an ACPI table into its
   VMs F-Segment (0xf2400).  This ACPI table includes full tables for RSDP,
   RSDT, XSDT, MADT, FADT, HPET, MCFG, FACS, and DSDT.  All these items are
   programmed according to acrn-dm command line configuration and derived from
   their default value.

----

``-B``, ``--bootargs <bootargs>``
   Set the User VM kernel command-line arguments. The maximum length is 1023.
   The bootargs string will be passed to the kernel as its cmdline.

   Example::

      -B "loglevel=7"

      specifies the kernel log level at 7

----

``--debugexit``
   Enable guest to write io port 0xf4 to exit guest. It's mainly used by guest
   unit test.

----

``-E``, ``--elf_file <elf image path>``
   This option is to define a static elf binary which could be loaded by DM.
   DM will run elf as guest of ACRN.

----

``--enable_trusty``
   Enable trusty for guest.  For Android guest OS, ACRN provides a VM
   environment with two worlds:  normal world and trusty world.  The Android
   OS runs in the the normal world.  The trusty OS and security sensitive
   applications runs in the trusty world.  The trusty world can see the memory
   of normal world but not vice versa.  See :ref:`trusty_tee` for more
   information.

   By default, the trusty world is disabled. Use this option to enable it.

----

``-h``, ``--help``
   Show a summary of commands.

----

``--intr_monitor <intr_monitor_params>``
   Enable interrupt storm monitor for User VM. Use this option to prevent an
   interrupt storm from the User VM.

   usage: ``--intr_monitor threshold/s probe-period(s) delay_time(ms) delay_duration(ms)``

   Example::

      --intr_monitor 10000,10,1,100

   -  ``10000``: interrupt rate larger than 10000/s will be treated as
      interrupt storm
   -  ``10``: use the last 10s of interrupt data to detect an interrupt storm
   -  ``1``: when interrupts are identified as a storm, the next interrupt
      will be delayed 1ms before being injected to the guest
   -  ``100``: after 100ms, we will cancel the interrupt injection delay and
      restore to normal.

----

``-k``, ``--kernel <kernel_image_path>``
   Set the kernel (full path) for the User VM kernel. The maximum path length
   is 1023 characters. The DM handles bzImage image format.

   usage: ``-k /path/to/your/kernel_image``

----

``-l``, ``--lpc <lpc_device_configuration>``
   (See ``-i``, ``--ioc_node``)

----

``-m``, ``--memsize <memory_size>``
   Setup total memory size for User VM.

   memory_size format is: "<size>{K/k, B/b, M/m, G/g}", and size is an
   integer.

   usage: ``-m 4g``: set User VM memory to 4 gigabytes.

----

``--mac_seed <seed_string>``
   Set a platform-unique string as a seed to generate the mac address.  Each
   VM should have a different "seed_string".  The "seed_string" can be
   generated by the following method where $(vm_name) contains the name of the
   VM you are going to launch.

   .. code-block::

      mac=$(cat /sys/class/net/e*/address)
      seed_string=${mac:9:8}-${vm_name}

----

``-r``, ``--ramdisk <ramdisk_image_path>``
   Set the ramdisk (full path) for the User VM. The maximum length is 1023.
   The supported ramdisk format depends on your User VM kernel configuration.

   usage: ``-r /path/to/your/ramdisk_image``

----

``-s``, ``--pci_slot <slot_config>``
   Setup PCI device configuration.

   slot_config format is::

      <bus>:<slot>:<func>,<emul>[,<config>]
      <slot>[:<func>],<emul>[,<config>]

   Where:

   -  ``slot`` is 0..31
   -  ``func`` is 0..7
   -  ``emul`` is a string describing the type of PCI device, e.g.
      virtio-net
   -  ``config`` is an optional device-dependent string, used for
      configuration.

   Examples::

      -s 7,xhci,1-2,2-2

   This configuration means the virtual xHCI will appear in PCI slot 7
   in User VM. Any physical USB device attached on 1-2 (bus 1, port 2) or
   2-2 (bus 2, port 2) will be detected by User VM and be used as expected. To
   determine which bus and port a USB device is attached, you could run
   ``lsusb -t`` in Service VM.

   ::

      -s 9,virtio-blk,/root/test.img

   This adds virtual block in PCI slot 9 and uses ``/root/test.img`` as the
   disk image.


   For more information about emulated device types, see :ref:'emul_config'.

----

``-v``, ``--version``
   Show Device Model version.

----

``--ovmf [w,]<ovmf_file_path>`` ``--ovmf [w,]code=<ovmf_code_file>,vars=<ovmf_vars_file>``
   Open Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF) is an EDK II based project to enable
   UEFI support for Virtual Machines.

   ACRN does not support off-the-shelf OVMF builds targeted for QEMU and KVM.
   Compatible OVMF images are included in the source tree, under
   ``devicemodel/bios/``.

   usage::

      --ovmf /usr/share/acrn/bios/OVMF.fd

   uses ``/usr/share/acrn/bios/OVMF.fd`` as the OVMF image

   ACRN also supports using OVMF split images; ``OVMF_CODE.fd`` that contains
   the OVMF firmware executable and ``OVMF_VARS.fd`` that contains the NV
   data store.

   usage::

      --ovmf code=/usr/share/acrn/bios/OVMF_CODE.fd,vars=/usr/share/acrn/bios/OVMF_VARS.fd

   ACRN supports the option "w" for OVMF. To preserve all changes in OVMF's
   NV data store section, use this option to enable writeback mode.

   Writeback mode is only enabled for the ``OVMF_VARS.fd`` file in case of
   OVMF split images, the firmware executable (``OVMF_CODE.fd``) remains
   read-only.

   usage::

      --ovmf w,/usr/share/acrn/bios/OVMF.fd

----

``--cpu_affinity <list of pCPUs>``
   list of pCPUs assigned to this VM.

   Example::

      --cpu_affinity 1,3

   to assign physical CPUs (pCPUs) 1 and 3 to this VM.

----

``--virtio_poll <poll_interval>``
   Enable virtio poll mode with poll interval xxx ns.

   Example::

      --virtio_poll 1000000

   enable virtio poll mode with poll interval 1ms.

----

``--acpidev_pt <HID>``
   This option is to enable ACPI device passthrough support. The ``HID`` is a
   mandatory parameter for this option which is the Hardware ID of the ACPI
   device.

   Example::

      --acpidev_pt MSFT0101

   To pass through a TPM (which HID is MSFT0101) ACPI device to a User VM.

----

``--mmiodev_pt <MMIO_Region>``
   This option is to enable MMIO device passthrough support.  The
   ``MMIO_Region`` is a mandatory parameter for this option which is the MMIO
   resource of the MMIO device.  The ``MMIO_Region`` needs to be the base
   address followed by the length of the region, both separated by a comma.

   Example::

      --mmiodev_pt 0xFED40000,0x00005000

   To pass through a MMIO device to a User VM.  The MMIO device has a MMIO
   region.  The base address of this region is 0xFED40000 and the size of the
   region is 0x00005000.

----

``--vtpm2 <sock_path>``
   This option is to enable virtual TPM support. The sock_path is a mandatory
   parameter for this option which is the path of swtpm socket fd.

----

``-W, --virtio_msix``
   This option forces virtio to use single-vector MSI.  By default, any
   virtio-based devices will use MSI-X as its interrupt method.  If you want
   to use single-vector MSI interrupt, you can do so using this option.

----

``--lapic_pt``
   This option is to create a VM with the local APIC (LAPIC) passed-through.
   With this option, a VM is created with ``LAPIC_PASSTHROUGH`` and
   ``IO_COMPLETION_POLLING`` mode. This option is typically used for hard
   real-time scenarios.

   By default, this option is not enabled.

----

``--rtvm``
   This option is used to create a VM with real-time attributes.  With this
   option, a VM is created with ``GUEST_FLAG_RT`` and
   ``GUEST_FLAG_IO_COMPLETION_POLLING`` mode.  This kind of VM is generally
   used for soft real-time scenarios (without ``--lapic_pt``) or hard
   real-time scenarios (with ``--lapic_pt``).  With ``GUEST_FLAG_RT``, the
   Service VM cannot interfere with this kind of VM when it is running.  It
   can only be powered off from inside the VM itself.

   By default, this option is not enabled.

----

``--logger_setting <console,level=4;disk,level=4;kmsg,level=3>``
   This option sets the level of logging that is used for each log channel.
   The general format of this option is ``<log channel>,level=<log level>``.
   Different log channels are separated by a semi-colon (``;``). The various
   log channels available are: ``console``, ``disk`` and ``kmsg``.  The log
   level ranges from 1 (``error``) up to 5 (``debug``).

   By default, the log severity level is set to 4 (``info``).

----

``--windows``
   This option is used to run Windows User VMs. It supports Oracle
   ``virtio-blk``, ``virtio-net`` and ``virtio-input`` devices for Windows
   guests with secure boot.

   usage::

      --windows

   .. note::
      This option is mandatory for running Windows in a User VM. If it is
      not used, Windows will not recognize the virtual disk.

----

``--ssram``
   This option enables Software SRAM passthrough to the VM.

   usage::

      --ssram

Emulated PCI Device Types
****************************

In the acrn-dm ``-s`` or ``--pci_slot`` command line parameter, there is a ``<slot_config>`` argument
that contains a string describing the type of emulated PCI device, along with optional device-dependent
arguments used for configuration.  Here is a table describing these emulated device types and arguments:

.. list-table:: Emulated PCI Device Types

   :widths: 20 80

   * - PCI Device Type string
     - Description

   * - ``xhci``
     - USB controller used to support USB 3.0 devices, (also supports USB 2.0
       and USB 1.0 devices).  Parameter ``<bus number>-<port number>`` should be
       added. The physical USB devices attached on the specified bus and port
       will be detected by User VM and used as expected, e.g., ``xhci,1-2,2-2``.

   * - ``lpc``
     - Low Pin Count (LPC) bus is used to connect low speed devices to the CPU,
       for example a serial port, keyboard, or mouse.

   * - ``igd-lpc``
     - Windows graphic driver requires this virtualized LPC device to operate
       the display function.

   * - ``ivshmem``
     - Inter-VM shared memory (ivshmem) virtualized PCI device used specifically
       for shared memory between VMs. Parameters should be added with the format
       ``ivshmem,<shm_name>,<shm_size>``. ``<shm-name>`` specifies a shared memory
       name, and must be listed in :option:`hv.FEATURES.IVSHMEM.IVSHMEM_REGION`
       as configured using the ACRN configurator tool UI, and needs to start
       with a ``dm:/`` prefix.

   * - ``ahci``
     - Advanced Host Controller Interface provides advanced features to access
       Serial ATA (SATA) storage devices, such as a hard disk. Parameter
       ``<type:><filepath>*`` should be added: ``type`` could be
       ``hd`` (harddisk) or ``cd`` (CD-ROM). ``<filepath>`` is the path for the
       backend file and could be a partition name or a regular file, e.g.,
       ``ahci,hd:/dev/sda``.

   * - ``ahci-hd``
     - This is an alias for ``ahci``.

   * - ``ahci-cd``
     - Advanced Host Controller Interface used to connect with AT Attachment
       Packet Interface device (for CD-ROM emulation). ``ahci-cd`` supports the same
       parameters than ``ahci``.

   * - ``amd_hostbridge``
     - Virtualized PCI AMD hostbridge

   * - ``hostbridge``
     - Virtualized PCI hostbridge, a hardware bridge between the CPU's
       high-speed system local bus and the Peripheral Component Interconnect
       (PCI) bus.

         when using vsbl as the virtual bootloader. 
       * ``<filepath>`` specifies the path of a file or disk partition. 
         You can also could use ``nodisk`` to create a virtio-blk device with a dummy backend.
         ``nodisk`` is used for hot-plugging a rootfs after the User VM has been launched. It is 
         achieved by triggering a rescan of the ``virtio-blk`` device by the User VM. The empty file 
         will be updated to valid file after rescan.
       * ``[,options]`` includes:

         * ``writethru``: write operation is reported completed only when the data
           has been written to physical storage.
         * ``writeback``: write operation is reported completed when data is placed
           in the page cache. Needs to be flushed to the physical storage.
         * ``ro``: open file with readonly mode.
         * ``sectorsize``: configured as either ``sectorsize=<sector size>/<physical sector size>``
           or ``sectorsize=<sector size>``. The default values for sector size and physical sector size are 512.
         * ``range``: configured as ``range=<start lba in file>/<sub file size>`` meaning the virtio-blk will
           only access part of the file, from the ``<start lba in file>`` to ``<start lba in file>`` + ``<sub file site>``.

   * - ``virtio-input``
     - Virtio type device to emulate input device. ``evdev`` char device node
       should be appended, e.g., ``-s

         ``2`` means ``/dev/i2c-2``.
       * ``<client_addr>`` specifies the address for the native client devices
         such as ``1C`` or  ``2F``.
       * ``@`` specifies the prefix for the ACPI node.
       * ``<node>`` specifies the ACPI node name supported in the
         ``acpi_node_table[]`` in the source code: only ``cam1``, ``cam2``, and
         ``hdac`` are supported for APL platform and  are platform-specific.
