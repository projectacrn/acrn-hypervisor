Device Model Parameters
#######################

Hypervisor Device Model (DM) is a QEMU-like application in the Service
VM responsible for creating a User VM and then performing devices
emulation based on command line configurations, as introduced in
:ref:`hld-devicemodel`.

Here are descriptions for each of these ``acrn-dm`` command line parameters:

``-A``, ``--acpi``
   Create ACPI tables.  With this option, DM will build an ACPI table into its
   VMs F-Segment (0xf2400).  This ACPI table includes full tables for RSDP,
   RSDT, XSDT, MADT, FADT, HPET, MCFG, FACS, and DSDT.  All these items are
   programmed according to acrn-dm command line configuration and derived from
   their default value.

----

``-B``, ``--bootargs <bootargs>``
   Set the User VM kernel command-line arguments. The maximum length is 1023.
   The bootargs string will be passed to the kernel as its cmdline.

   Example::

      -B "loglevel=7"

      specifies the kernel log level at 7

----

``--debugexit``
   Enable guest to write io port 0xf4 to exit guest. It's mainly used by guest
   unit test.

----

``-E``, ``--elf_file <elf image path>``
   This option is to define a static elf binary which could be loaded by DM.
   DM will run elf as guest of ACRN.

----

``--enable_trusty``
   Enable trusty for guest.  For Android guest OS, ACRN provides a VM
   environment with two worlds:  normal world and trusty world.  The Android
   OS runs in the the normal world.  The trusty OS and security sensitive
   applications runs in the trusty world.  The trusty world can see the memory
   of normal world but not vice versa.  See :ref:`trusty_tee` for more
   information.

   By default, the trusty world is disabled. Use this option to enable it.

----

``-G``, ``--gvtargs <GVT_args>``
   ACRN implements GVT-g for graphics virtualization (aka AcrnGT).  This
   option allows you to set some of its parameters.

   GVT_args format: ``low_gm_sz high_gm_sz fence_sz``

   Where:

   -  ``low_gm_sz``: GVT-g aperture size, unit is MB
   -  ``high_gm_sz``: GVT-g hidden gfx memory size, unit is MB
   -  ``fence_sz``: the number of fence registers

   Example::

      -G "10 128 6"

      sets up 10Mb for GVT-g aperture, 128M for GVT-g hidden memory, and 6
      fence registers.

----

``-h``, ``--help``
   Show a summary of commands.

----

``-i``, ``--ioc_node <ioc_mediator_parameters>``
   IOC (IO Controller) is a bridge of an SoC to communicate with Vehicle Bus.
   It routes Vehicle Bus signals, for example extracted from CAN messages,
   from IOC to the SoC and back, as well as controlling the onboard
   peripherals from SoC.  (The ``-i`` and ``-l`` parameters are only available
   on a platform with IOC.)

   IOC DM opens ``/dev/ptmx`` device to create a peer PTY devices, IOC DM uses
   these to communicate with UART DM since UART DM needs a TTY capable device
   as its backend.

   The device model configuration command syntax for IOC mediator is::

      -i,[ioc_channel_path],[wakeup_reason]
      -l,[lpc_port],[ioc_channel_path]

   -  ``ioc_channel_path`` is an absolute path for communication between IOC
      mediator and UART DM.
   -  ``lpc_port`` is com1 or com2. IOC mediator needs one unassigned lpc
      port for data transfer between User OS and Service OS.
   -  ``wakeup_reason`` is IOC mediator boot reason, where each bit represents
      one wakeup reason.

   Currently the wakeup reason bits supported by IOC firmware are:

   -  ``CBC_WK_RSN_BTN`` (bit 5): ignition button.
   -  ``CBC_WK_RSN_RTC`` (bit 9): RTC timer.
   -  ``CBC_WK_RSN_DOR`` (bit 11): Car door.
   -  ``CBC_WK_RSN_SOC`` (bit 23): SoC active/inactive.

   As an example, the following commands are used to enable IOC feature, the
   initial wakeup reason is ignition button, and cbc_attach uses ttyS1 for TTY
   line discipline in User VM::

      -i /run/acrn/ioc_$vm_name,0x20
      -l com2,/run/acrn/ioc_$vm_name

----

``--intr_monitor <intr_monitor_params>``
   Enable interrupt storm monitor for User VM. Use this option to prevent an
   interrupt storm from the User VM.

   usage: ``--intr_monitor threshold/s probe-period(s) delay_time(ms) delay_duration(ms)``

   Example::

      --intr_monitor 10000,10,1,100

   -  ``10000``: interrupt rate larger than 10000/s will be treated as
      interrupt storm
   -  ``10``: use the last 10s of interrupt data to detect an interrupt storm
   -  ``1``: when interrupts are identified as a storm, the next interrupt
      will be delayed 1ms before being injected to the guest
   -  ``100``: after 100ms, we will cancel the interrupt injection delay and
      restore to normal.

----

``-k``, ``--kernel <kernel_image_path>``
   Set the kernel (full path) for the User VM kernel. The maximum path length
   is 1023 characters. The DM handles bzImage image format.

   usage: ``-k /path/to/your/kernel_image``

----

``-l``, ``--lpc <lpc_device_configuration>``
   (See ``-i``, ``--ioc_node``)

----

``-m``, ``--memsize <memory_size>``
   Setup total memory size for User VM.

   memory_size format is: "<size>{K/k, B/b, M/m, G/g}", and size is an
   integer.

   usage: ``-m 4g``: set User VM memory to 4 gigabytes.

----

``--mac_seed <seed_string>``
   Set a platform-unique string as a seed to generate the mac address.  Each
   VM should have a different "seed_string".  The "seed_string" can be
   generated by the following method where $(vm_name) contains the name of the
   VM you are going to launch.

   .. code-block::

      mac=$(cat /sys/class/net/e*/address)
      seed_string=${mac:9:8}-${vm_name}

----

``--part_info <part_info_name>``
   Set guest partition info path.

----

``-r``, ``--ramdisk <ramdisk_image_path>``
   Set the ramdisk (full path) for the User VM. The maximum length is 1023.
   The supported ramdisk format depends on your User VM kernel configuration.

   usage: ``-r /path/to/your/ramdisk_image``

----

``-s``, ``--pci_slot <slot_config>``
   Setup PCI device configuration.

   slot_config format is::

      <bus>:<slot>:<func>,<emul>[,<config>]
      <slot>[:<func>],<emul>[,<config>]

   Where:

   -  ``slot`` is 0..31
   -  ``func`` is 0..7
   -  ``emul`` is a string describing the type of PCI device, e.g.
      virtio-net
   -  ``config`` is an optional device-dependent string, used for
      configuration.

   Examples::

      -s 7,xhci,1-2,2-2

   This configuration means the virtual xHCI will appear in PCI slot 7
   in User VM. Any physical USB device attached on 1-2 (bus 1, port 2) or
   2-2 (bus 2, port 2) will be detected by User VM and be used as expected. To
   determine which bus and port a USB device is attached, you could run
   ``lsusb -t`` in Service VM.

   ::

      -s 9,virtio-blk,/root/test.img

   This adds virtual block in PCI slot 9 and uses ``/root/test.img`` as the
   disk image.

----

``-U``, ``--uuid <uuid>``
   Set UUID for a VM.  Every VM is identified by a UUID.  You can define that
   UUID with this option.  If you don't use this option, a default one
   ("d2795438-25d6-11e8-864e-cb7a18b34643") will be used.

   usage::

      -u "42795636-1d31-6512-7432-087d33b34756"

   set the newly created VM's UUID to ``42795636-1d31-6512-7432-087d33b34756``

----

``-v``, ``--version``
   Show Device Model version.

----

``--vsbl <vsbl_file_path>``
   Virtual Slim bootloader (vSBL) is the virtual bootloader supporting booting
   of the User VM on the ACRN hypervisor platform.  The vSBL design is derived
   from Slim Bootloader, which follows a staged design approach that provides
   hardware initialization and launching a payload that provides the boot
   logic.

   The vSBL image is installed on the Service OS root filesystem by the
   service-os bundle, in ``/usr/share/acrn/bios/``.  In the current design,
   the vSBL supports booting Android guest OS or Linux guest OS using the same
   vSBL image.  For Android VM, the vSBL will load and verify trusty OS first,
   and trusty OS will then load and verify Android OS according to Android OS
   verification mechanism.

   .. note::
      vSBL is currently only supported on Apollo Lake processors.

   usage::

      --vsbl /usr/share/acrn/bios/VSBL.bin

   uses ``/usr/share/acrn/bios/VSBL.bin`` as the vSBL image.

----

``--ovmf [w,]<ovmf_file_path>`` ``--ovmf [w,]code=<ovmf_code_file>,vars=<ovmf_vars_file>``
   Open Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF) is an EDK II based project to enable
   UEFI support for Virtual Machines.

   ACRN does not support off-the-shelf OVMF builds targeted for QEMU and KVM.
   Compatible OVMF images are included in the source tree, under
   ``devicemodel/bios/``.

   usage::

      --ovmf /usr/share/acrn/bios/OVMF.fd

   uses ``/usr/share/acrn/bios/OVMF.fd`` as the OVMF image

   ACRN also supports using OVMF split images; ``OVMF_CODE.fd`` that contains
   the OVMF firmware executable and ``OVMF_VARS.fd`` that contains the NV
   data store.

   usage::

      --ovmf code=/usr/share/acrn/bios/OVMF_CODE.fd,vars=/usr/share/acrn/bios/OVMF_VARS.fd

   ACRN supports the option "w" for OVMF. To preserve all changes in OVMF's
   NV data store section, use this option to enable writeback mode.

   Writeback mode is only enabled for the ``OVMF_VARS.fd`` file in case of
   OVMF split images, the firmware executable (``OVMF_CODE.fd``) remains
   read-only.

   usage::

      --ovmf w,/usr/share/acrn/bios/OVMF.fd

----

``--cpu_affinity <list of pCPUs>``
   list of pCPUs assigned to this VM.

   Example::

      --cpu_affinity 1,3

   to assign physical CPUs (pCPUs) 1 and 3 to this VM.

----

``--virtio_poll <poll_interval>``
   Enable virtio poll mode with poll interval xxx ns.

   Example::

      --virtio_poll 1000000

   enable virtio poll mode with poll interval 1ms.

----

``--acpidev_pt <HID>``
   This option is to enable ACPI device passthrough support. The ``HID`` is a
   mandatory parameter for this option which is the Hardware ID of the ACPI
   device.

   Example::

      --acpidev_pt MSFT0101

   To pass through a TPM (which HID is MSFT0101) ACPI device to a User VM.

----

``--mmiodev_pt <MMIO_Region>``
   This option is to enable MMIO device passthrough support.  The
   ``MMIO_Region`` is a mandatory parameter for this option which is the MMIO
   resource of the MMIO device.  The ``MMIO_Region`` needs to be the base
   address followed by the length of the region, both separated by a comma.

   Example::

      --mmiodev_pt 0xFED40000,0x00005000

   To pass through a MMIO device to a User VM.  The MMIO device has a MMIO
   region.  The base address of this region is 0xFED40000 and the size of the
   region is 0x00005000.

----

``--vtpm2 <sock_path>``
   This option is to enable virtual TPM support. The sock_path is a mandatory
   parameter for this option which is the path of swtpm socket fd.

----

``-W, --virtio_msix``
   This option forces virtio to use single-vector MSI.  By default, any
   virtio-based devices will use MSI-X as its interrupt method.  If you want
   to use single-vector MSI interrupt, you can do so using this option.

----

``-Y, --mptgen``
   Disable MPtable generation.  The MultiProcessor Specification (MPS) for the
   x86 architecture is an open standard describing enhancements to both
   operating systems and firmware that allows them to work with x86-compatible
   processors in a multi-processor configuration.  MPS covers Advanced
   Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC) architectures.

   By default, DM will create the MPtable for you.  Use this option to disable
   it.

----

``--lapic_pt``
   This option is to create a VM with the local APIC (LAPIC) passed-through.
   With this option, a VM is created with ``LAPIC_PASSTHROUGH`` and
   ``IO_COMPLETION_POLLING`` mode. This option is typically used for hard
   real-time scenarios.

   By default, this option is not enabled.

----

``--rtvm``
   This option is used to create a VM with real-time attributes.  With this
   option, a VM is created with ``GUEST_FLAG_RT`` and
   ``GUEST_FLAG_IO_COMPLETION_POLLING`` mode.  This kind of VM is generally
   used for soft real-time scenarios (without ``--lapic_pt``) or hard
   real-time scenarios (with ``--lapic_pt``).  With ``GUEST_FLAG_RT``, the
   Service VM cannot interfere with this kind of VM when it is running.  It
   can only be powered off from inside the VM itself.

   By default, this option is not enabled.

----

``--logger_setting <console,level=4;disk,level=4;kmsg,level=3>``
   This option sets the level of logging that is used for each log channel.
   The general format of this option is ``<log channel>,level=<log level>``.
   Different log channels are separated by a semi-colon (``;``). The various
   log channels available are: ``console``, ``disk`` and ``kmsg``.  The log
   level ranges from 1 (``error``) up to 5 (``debug``).

   By default, the log severity level is set to 4 (``info``).

----

``--pm_notify_channel <channel>``
   This option is used to define which channel could be used DM to
   communicate with VM about power management event.

   ACRN supports three channels: ``ioc``, ``power button`` and ``uart``.

   usage::

      --pm_notify_channel ioc

   Use ioc as power management event motify channel.

----

``--pm_by_vuart [pty|tty],<node_path>``
   This option is used to set a user OS power management by virtual UART.
   With acrn-dm UART emulation and hypervisor UART emulation and configure,
   service OS can communicate with user OS through virtual UART. By this
   option, service OS can notify user OS to shutdown itself by vUART.

   It must work with `--pm_notify_channel` and PCI UART setting (lpc and -l).

   Example::

      for general User VM, such as LaaG or WaaG, it must set:
         --pm_notify_channel uart --pm_by_vuart pty,/run/acrn/life_mngr_vm1
         -l com2,/run/acrn/life_mngr_vm1
      for RTVM, like RT-Linux:
         --pm_notify_channel uart --pm_by_vuart tty,/dev/ttyS1

      For a different User VM, it can be configured as needed.

----

``--windows``
   This option is used to run Windows User VMs. It supports Oracle
   ``virtio-blk``, ``virtio-net`` and ``virtio-input`` devices for Windows
   guests with secure boot.

   usage::

      --windows

----

``--psram``
   This option enables Pseudo (Software) SRAM passthrough to the VM.

   usage::

      --psram
