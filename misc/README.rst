ACRN tools
##########

The open source `Project ACRN`_ defines a device hypervisor reference stack and
an architecture for running multiple software subsystems, managed securely, on
a consolidated system by means of a virtual machine manager. It also defines a
reference framework implementation for virtual device emulation, called the
"ACRN Device Model".

This folder holds the source to a number of tools that facilitate the
management, debugging, profiling, and logging of multi-OS systems based on
ACRN.

You can find out more about Project ACRN and its set of tools on the
`Project ACRN documentation`_ website.
