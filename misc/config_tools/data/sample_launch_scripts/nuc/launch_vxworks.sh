#      Here we just launch VxWorks as a normal vm without lapic pt. If you want try it

#      driver use polling mode (This feature is not supported by VxWorks offically now and should
#      be implemented it by youself).
#
#      --lapic_pt \
#      --virtio_poll 1000000 \
#      -U $rtvm_uuid \
#
#      Once the front-end polling mode virtio-console get supported by VxWorks offically, we will
#      set the lapic_pt option as default.
