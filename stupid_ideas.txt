This file just holds my stupid ideas.

Stupid ideas are stupid, non verified ideas, I just got while reading something here and there and getting some thoughts.
Maybe this is helpful for me or others some point in time later.

ACRN-Hypervisor:
ACRN is booted using EFI and GRUB, this is complicated.
So as ACRN wants to be embedded, so combine it with coreboot and boot into the hypervisor right away.
Having a running ACRN hypervisor just after board bring up, booted from the flash of the x86_64 mainboard's 
BIOS flash gives you a chain of trust while booting. 
In the hypervisor ACRN you can try to boot something like linux, xBSD or commecrial operating systems.
As ACRN claims to be a type 1 hypervisor this shoud work and one will get a secured embedded platform.
This should be tested using a Lenovo X220

So one can try to have a ACRN payload in coreboot.
