Description
***********

The ``acrnprobe`` is a tool to detect all critical events on the platform and
collect specific information for them. The collected information would be saved
as logs. The log path would be delivered to `telemetrics-client`_ as a record if
telemetrics-client exists on the system. In this case ``acrnprobe`` works as a
*probe* of telemetrics-client. If telemetrics-client doesn't exist on the
system, ``acrnprobe`` provides ``history_event`` (under ``/var/log/crashlog/``
by default) to manage the crash and events records on the platform instead of
``telem_journal``. But in this case, the records can't be delivered to the
backend.

Usage
*****

The ``acrnprobe`` is launched as a service at boot. Also, it provides some basic
options:

Specify a configuration file for ``acrnprobe``. If this option is unused,
``acrnprobe`` will use the configuration file located in CUSTOM CONFIGURATION
PATH or INSTALLATION PATH (see `CONFIGURATION FILES`_).

.. code-block:: none

   $ acrnprobe -c [configuration_path]

.. code-block:: none

   $ acrnprobe -V

Architecture
************

Syntax
======

- channel :
  Channel represents a way of detecting the system's events. There are 3
  channels:

  + oneshot: detect once while ``acrnprobe`` startup.
  + polling: run a detecting job with fixed time interval.
  + inotify: monitor the change of file or dir.

- event queue :
  There is a global queue to receive all events detected.
  Generally, events are enqueued in channel, and dequeued in event handler.

- event handler :
  Event handler is a thread to handle events detected by channel.
  It's awakened by an enqueued event.

- sender :
  The sender corresponds to an exit of event.
  There are two senders:

  + Crashlog is responsible for collecting logs and saving it locally.
  + Telemd is responsible for sending log records to telemetrics client.

Description
===========

As a log collection mechanism to record critical events on the platform,
``acrnprobe`` provides these functions:

1. detect event

   From experience, the occurrence of an system event is usually accompanied
   by some effects. The effects could be a generated file, an error message in
   kernel's log, or a system reboot. To get these effects, for some of them we
   can monitor a directory, for other of them we might need to do a detection
   in a time loop.
   *So we implement the channel, which represents a common method of detection.*

2. analyze event and determine the event type

   Generally, a specific effect correspond to a particular type of events.
   However, it is the icing on the cake for analyzing the detailed event types
   according to some phenomena. *Crash reclassify is implemented for this
   purpose.*

3. collect information for detected events

   This is for debug purpose. Events without information are meaningless,
   and developers need to use this information to improve their system. *Sender
   crashlog is implemented for this purpose.*

4. archive these information as logs, and generate records

   There must be a central place to tell user what happened in system.
   *Sender telemd is implemented for this purpose.*
