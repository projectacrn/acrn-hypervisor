``acrnctl``
===========


DESCRIPTION
___________

``acrnctl``: The ``acrnctl`` tool can help user create, delete, launch and stop UOSs.
It runs under Service OS, and UOSs should be based on ``acrn-dm`` 


USAGE
_____

To see what it can do, just run:

::

# acrnctl


or

::

# acrnctl help

you may see:

::

  support:
    list
    start
    stop
    del
    add
  Use acrnctl [cmd] help for details

There are examples:

(1) add a VM
    Each time you can just add one VM. Suppose you have an UOS
    launch script, such as launch_UOS.sh

    you can run:

::

  # acrnctl add launch_UOS.sh -U 1
    vm1-14:59:30 added

Note that, launch script shoud be able to launch ONE UOS. If
it fail, it is better to print some error logs, to tell user
the reason, so that he knows how to solve it.
The vmname is important, the acrnctl searchs VMs by their
names. so duplicated VM names are not allowed. Beside, if the
launch script changes VM name at launch time, acrnctl will
not recgonize it.

(2) delete VMs

::

  # acrnctl del vm1-14:59:30

(3) show VMs

::

  # acrnctl list
    vm1-14:59:30            untracked
    vm-yocto                stop
    vm-android              stop

(4) start VM

    you can start a vm with 'stop' status, each time can start
    one VM.

::

  # acrnctl start vm-yocto

(5) stop VM

    you can stop VMs, if their status is not 'stop'

::

  # acrnctl stop vm-yocto vm1-14:59:30 vm-android
